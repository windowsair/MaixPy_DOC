### image.load_decriptor(path)

Load a descriptor object from the disk.

Path is the path where the descriptor file is saved.

### image.save_descriptor(path, descriptor)

Save the descriptor object descriptor to disk.

Path is the path where the descriptor file is saved.

### image.match_descriptor(descritor0, descriptor1[, threshold=70[, filter_outliers=False]])

For the LBP descriptor, this function returns an integer that represents the difference between the two descriptors. This distance measurement is especially necessary. This distance is a measure of similarity. The closer this measure is to 0, the better the LBPF feature points will match.

For the ORB descriptor, this function returns the kptmatch object. See above.

Threshold is used to filter the ambiguous matching service for the ORB keypoint.
A lower threshold value will be tied to the keypoint matching algorithm. The threshold value is at 0-100 (int). The default is 70.

Filter_outliers is used to filter outliers for ORB keypoints. Feature points allow the user to increase the threshold value. The default setting is False.

## HaarCascade Class – Feature Descriptors

The Haar Cascade feature descriptor is used for the `image.find_features()` method. It has no methods for the user to call.

### Constructor

Class image.HaarCascade(path[, stages=Auto])

Load a Haar Cascade from a Haar Cascade binary (a format suitable for OpenMV Cam). If you pass a "frontalface" string instead of a path, this constructor will load a built-in positive face Haar Cascade into memory. In addition, you can also load Haar Cascade into memory via "eye". Finally, this method returns the loaded Haar Cascade object, which is used to use image.find_features() .

The stage default is the number of stages in Haar Cascade. However, you can specify a lower value to speed up the running of the feature detector, which of course leads to a higher false positive rate.

> You can make your own Haar Cascades to work with your OpenMV Cam. First, use Google search "<thing> Haar Cascade" to check if someone has created OpenCV Haar Cascade for the object you want to detect. If not, you need to do it yourself (the amount of work is huge). For information on how to make your own Haar Cascade, see here on how to turn OpenCV Haar Cascades into a mode that your OpenMV Cam can read, see this script

Q: What is Haar Cascade?

A: Haar Cascade is a series of comparison checks used to determine if an object is present in an image. This series of comparison checks is divided into phases, and the operation of the latter phase is premised on the completion of the previous phase. Contrast checks are not complicated, but are like processes that check if the center of the image is slightly more vertical than the edges. A wide range of inspections are carried out first in the early stages, and more small area inspections are carried out later.

Q: How was Haar Cascades made?

A: Haar Cascades trains generator algorithms with positive and negative images. For example, use hundreds of pictures containing cats (marked as containing cats) and hundreds of pictures that do not contain cats (have been marked differently) to train this generation algorithm. This generation algorithm will eventually generate a Haar Cascades for detecting cats.

###method

#### imagewriter.size()

Returns the size of the file being written.

#### imagewriter.add_frame(img)

Write an image to disk. Because the image is not compressed, it performs quickly but takes up a lot of disk space.

#### imagewriter.close()

###method

#### imagereader.size()

Returns the size of the file being read.

Imagereader.next_frame([copy_to_fb=True, loop=True])
Returns an image object from a file written by ImageWriter. If copy_to_fb is True, the image object will be loaded directly into the frame buffer. Otherwise the image object will be placed in the heap. Note: Unless the image is small, the heap may not have enough space to store the image object. If loop is True, playback will resume after the last image of the stream has been read. Otherwise, this method will return None after all frames have been read.

Note: imagereader.next_frame attempts to limit the playback speed by pausing playback after reading the frame to match the speed of the frame recording. Otherwise, this method will play all images at a speed of 200+FPS.

#### imagereader.close()

Close the file being read. You need to do this to prevent the imagereader object from being damaged. However, since it is a read-only file, the file will not be damaged when it is not closed.

## ImageClass - Image Object

Image objects are the basic objects of machine vision operations.

### Constructor

Class image.Image(path[, copy_to_fb=False])

Create a new image object from the file in path.

Support image files in bmp/pgm/ppm/jpg/jpeg format.

If copy_to_fb is True, the image will be loaded directly into the framebuffer and you can load large images. If False, the image will be loaded into the MicroPython heap, which is much smaller than the frame buffer.

In OpenMV Cam M4, if copy_to_fb is False, you should try to keep the image size below 8KB. If True, the image can be up to 160KB.
In OpenMV Cam M7, if copy_to_fb is False, you should try to keep the image size below 16KB. If True, the image can be up to 320KB.
The image supports the "[]" notation. Let image[index] = 8/16-bit value to assign image pixels or image[index] and get an image pixel. If it is a grayscale image of 16-bit RGB565 value for RGB image, this pixel is 8 Bit.

For JPEG images, "[]" gives you access to JPEG image patches in the form of compressed section arrays. Since JPEG images are in the form of compressed byte streams, reading and writing of data sets is opaque.

The image also supports read buffer operations. You can use the image as a section array object and enter the image into all types of MicroPython functions. If you want to transfer an image, you can pass it to the UART / SPI / I2C write function for automatic transfer.

###method

This method allows you to create a reduced copy of the image.

Compressed images and bayer images are not supported.

#### image.to_grayscale([copy=False])

Convert the image to a grayscale image. This method also modifies the base image pixels and changes the image size in bytes, so it can only be done on grayscale images or RGB565 images. Otherwise copy must be True to create a new modified image on the heap.

Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method.

Compressed images and bayer images are not supported.

#### image.to_rgb565([copy=False])

A rainbow image is a color image that has a unique color value for each 8-bit mask grayscale illumination value in the image. For example, it provides a heat map color for a thermal image.

Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method.

Compressed images and bayer images are not supported.

#### image.compress([quality=50])

JPEG properly compresses the image. Using this method to use a higher quality compression ratio is at the expense of destroying the original image compared to the compressed save heap space.

Quality is the compression quality (0-100) (int).

#### image.compress_for_ide([quality=50])

JPEG properly compresses the image. Using this method to use a higher quality compression ratio is at the expense of destroying the original image compared to the compressed save heap space.

You need to use this method to format the image data for display in the terminal window created by Open Terminal in OpenMV IDE.

Quality is the compression quality (0-100) (int).

#### image.compressed([quality=50])

#### image.copy([roi[, copy_to_fb=False]])

Create a copy of the image object.

Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI copies the image rectangle of the entire image. But this does not apply to JPEG images.

Remember that the image copy is stored in the MicroPython heap instead of the frame buffer. Again, you need to keep the image copy size below 8KB (OpenMV) or below 16KB (OpenMV Cam M7). If you want to use a copy operation to use all the heap space, this function will get an exception. An oversized image can easily trigger an exception.

If copy_to_fb is True, this method replaces the framebuffer with an image. The frame buffer has much larger space than the heap and can accommodate large images.

#### image.save(path[, roi[, quality=50]])

Save a copy of the image to the file system in path.

Support image files in bmp/pgm/ppm/jpg/jpeg format. Note: You cannot save a compressed image in jpeg format to an uncompressed format.

Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI copies the image rectangle of the entire image. But this does not apply to JPEG images.

The thresholds must be a list of tuples. [(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)] Define the range of colors you want to track. For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values ​​- the minimum gray value and the maximum gray value. Only pixel regions that fall between these thresholds are considered. For RGB565 images, each tuple needs to have six values ​​(l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - the minimum and maximum values ​​for the LAB L, A and B channels, respectively. For ease of use, this feature will automatically fix the minimum and maximum values ​​of the exchange. Also, if the tuple is greater than six values, the remaining values ​​are ignored. Conversely, if the tuple is too short, the remaining thresholds are assumed to be in the maximum range.

annotation

To get the threshold of the tracked object, simply select (click and drag) the tracking object in the IDE framebuffer. The histogram will be updated accordingly to the area. Then just write down the color distribution in the starting and falling positions in each histogram channel. These will be the low and high values ​​of thresholds. Since the difference between the upper and lower quartiles is small, the threshold is manually determined.

You can also determine the color threshold by going to Tools -> Machine Vision -> Threshold Editor in the OpenMV IDE and dragging the slider from the GUI window.

Invert Reverses the threshold operation, where pixels are matched outside of the known color range, not within the known color range.

Set zero to True to make the threshold pixel zero and leave the pixels that are not in the threshold list unchanged.

#### image.remove_shadows([image])

Remove the shadow from the image.

If the current image does not have a "shadowless" version, this method will attempt to remove the shadow from the image, but there is no true unshaded image basis.

Note that this method takes many seconds to run and is only suitable for removing shadows in real time, dynamically generating an unshadowed version of the image. Future versions of the algorithm will work for more environments, but equally slow.

If the current image has a "shadowless" version, this method will remove all shadows in the image using the "true source" background unshadowed image to filter out the shadows. Non-shaded pixels are not filtered out, so you can add new objects that didn't exist before to the scene, and any non-shaded pixels in those objects will be displayed.

#### image.get_histogram([thresholds[, invert=False[, roi[, bins[, l_bins[, a_bins[, b_bins]]]]]])

Normalize histogram operations on all color channels of roi and return histogram objects. Please refer to the histogram object for more information. You can also call this method using image.get_hist or image.histogram . If you pass the thresholds list, the histogram information will only be calculated from the pixels in the threshold list.

The thresholds must be a list of tuples. [(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)] Define the range of colors you want to track. For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values ​​- the minimum gray value and the maximum gray value. Only pixel regions that fall between these thresholds are considered. For RGB565 images, each tuple needs to have six values ​​(l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - the minimum and maximum values ​​for the LAB L, A and B channels, respectively. For ease of use, this feature will automatically fix the minimum and maximum values ​​of the exchange. Also, if the tuple is greater than six values, the remaining values ​​are ignored. Conversely, if the tuple is too short, the remaining thresholds are assumed to be in the maximum range.

annotation

To get the threshold of the tracked object, simply select (click and drag) the tracking object in the IDE framebuffer. The histogram will be updated accordingly to the area. Then just write down the color distribution in the starting and falling positions in each histogram channel. These will be the low and high values ​​of thresholds. Since the difference between the upper and lower quartiles is small, the threshold is manually determined.

You can also determine the color threshold by going to Tools -> Machine Vision -> Threshold Editor in the OpenMV IDE and dragging the slider from the GUI window.

Invert Reverses the threshold operation, where pixels are matched outside of the known color range, not within the known color range.

Unless you need to use color statistics for advanced operations, simply use the `image.get_statistics()` method instead of this method to see the pixel areas in the image.

Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area.

Bins and other bins are the number of bins used for the histogram channel. For grayscale images, use bins, for RGB565 images, use each of the other channels. The bin count for each channel must be greater than 2. In addition, it makes no sense to set the bin count to a number greater than the unique pixel value of each channel. By default, the histogram will have the maximum number of bins per channel.

Compressed images and bayer images are not supported.

#### image.get_statistics([thresholds[, invert=False[, roi[, bins[, l_bins[, a_bins[, b_bins]]]]]])

#### image.get_regression(thresholds[, invert=False[, roi[, x_stride=2[, y_stride=1[, area_threshold=10[, pixels_threshold=10[, robust=False]]]]]])

Perform linear regression calculations on all threshold pixels of the image. This calculation is done by least squares, which is usually faster, but does not handle any outliers. If robust is True, the Theil index will be used. The Theil index calculates the median of all slopes between all threshold pixels in the image. If you set too many pixels after the threshold transition, even on an 80x60 image, this N^2 operation may lower your FPS below 5. However, as long as the number of pixels to be set after the threshold conversion is small, linear regression is effective even when the threshold pixel exceeding 30% is an abnormal value.

This method returns an image.line object. How to easily use straight line objects, see the following blog post: https://openmv.io/blogs/news/linear-regression-line-following

Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area.

X_stride is the number of x pixels that need to be skipped when looking for a patch. Once the color block is found, the line fill algorithm will be precise pixels. If the color block is known to be large, increase x_stride to increase the speed at which the color block is found.

Y_stride is the number of y pixels that need to be skipped when looking for a patch. Once the color block is found, the line fill algorithm will be precise pixels. If the color block is known to be large, increase y_stride to increase the speed at which the patch is found.

If the bounding box area of ​​a patch is smaller than area_threshold, it will be filtered out.

If the number of pixels in a patch is smaller than pixel_threshold, it will be filtered out.

Merge If True, merges all the patches that have not been filtered. The border rectangles of these patches overlap each other. Margin can be used in the intersection test to increase or decrease the size of the patch boundary rectangle. For example, patches with edges of 1 and border rectangles of 1 will be merged.

Merging patches allows color code tracking to be achieved. Each patch object has a code value code , which is a bit vector. For example, if you enter two color thresholds in image.find_blobs, the first threshold code is 1 and the second code is 2 (the third code is 4, the fourth code is 8, and so on). Merged patches use logical OR operations on all code so you know the color that produced them. This allows you to track two colors, and if you get a patch object in two colors, it might be a color code.

If you use a strict color range and cannot fully track all the pixels of the target object, you may need to merge the patches.

Finally, if you want to merge the patches, but don't want the two different threshold colors to be merged, just call image.find_blobs twice, and the different threshold patches will not be merged.

The threshold_cb can be set to a function that calls each color block after threshold filtering to filter it out of the list of patches to be merged. The callback function will receive a parameter: the patch object to be filtered. The callback function then returns True to preserve the color block or return False to filter the color block.

Merge_cb can be set to function to call two patches to be merged to disable or permit the merge. The callback function will receive two arguments - two patch objects that will be merged. The callback function must return True to merge the color blocks, or return False to prevent color block merging.

#### image.find_qrcodes([roi])

Find all the QR codes in roi and return a list of image.qrcode objects. Please refer to the image.qrcode object for more information.

In order for this method to work successfully, the QR code on the image needs to be flat. By using the sensor.set_windowing function to zoom in at the center of the lens, the image.lens_corr function to dissipate the barrel distortion of the lens, or by replacing a lens with a narrow field of view, you get a flatter QR code that is unaffected by lens distortion.

Image.find_apriltags([roi[, families=image.TAG36H11[, fx[, fy[, cx[, cy]]]]])
Find all AprilTags in roi and return a list of image.apriltag objects. Please refer to the image.apriltag object for more information.

Compared to QR codes, AprilTags can be detected in longer distances, poorer light, and more distorted image environments. AprilTags can handle all kinds of image distortion problems, and the QR code does not. That is, AprilTags can only encode the digital ID as its payload.

AprilTags can also be used for localization. Each image.apriltag object returns its three-dimensional position information and rotation angle from the camera. The position information is determined by fx, fy, cx, and cy, which are the focal length and center point of the image in the X and Y directions, respectively.

> Create AprilTags using the Tag Generator tool built into OpenMV IDE. The tag generator creates a printable 8.5"x11" AprilTags.

Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area.

image.TAG16H5
image.TAG25H7
image.TAG25H9
image.TAG36H10
image.TAG36H11
image.ARTOOLKIT
The default setting is the best image.TAG36H11 tag family. Note: every time a tag family is enabled, the speed of find_apriltags will be slightly slower.

Fx is the focal length of the camera's x-direction in pixels. The value of the standard OpenMV Cam is (2.8 / 3.984) * 656, which is obtained by dividing the focal length value of the millimeter by the length of the photosensitive element in the X direction and multiplying by the number of pixels of the photosensitive element in the X direction (for the OV7725 photosensitive element) In terms of).

Fy is the focal length of the camera in the y direction in pixels. The value of the standard OpenMV Cam is (2.8 / 2.952) * 488, which is obtained by dividing the focal length value of the millimeter meter by the length of the photosensitive element in the Y direction, and multiplying by the number of pixels of the photosensitive element in the Y direction (for the OV7725 photosensitive element) In terms of).

Cx is the center of the image, image.width()/2 , not roi.w()/2 .

Cy is the center of the image, image.height()/2, not roi.h()/2 .

Image.find_datamatrices([roi[, effort=200]])
Finds all the data matrices in roi and returns a list of image.datamatrix objects. Please refer to the image.datamatrix object for more information.

In order for this method to work successfully, the rectangular code on the image needs to be flat. By using the sensor.set_windowing function to zoom in on the center of the lens, the image.lens_corr function to dissipate the barrel distortion of the lens, or by replacing a lens with a narrow field of view, you get a flatter rectangular code that is unaffected by lens distortion. Some machine vision lenses do not cause barrel distortion, but they are much more expensive than the standard lenses offered by OpenMV, which is an undistorted lens.

Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area.

The effort controls the time used to find the rectangular code match. The default value of 200 should apply to all use cases. However, you may also increase the detection at the expense of the frame rate or increase the frame rate at the expense of detection. Note: If the effort is set below about 160, you will not be able to perform any tests; instead, you can set it to any high value you want, but if the setting is higher than 240, the detection rate will not continue to increase.

Compressed images and bayer images are not supported.

This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4.

#### image.find_barcodes([roi])

Find all the 1D barcodes in roi and return a list of image.barcode objects. Please refer to the image.barcode object for more information.

For best results, use a long 640, wide 40/80/160 window. The lower the degree of verticality, the faster the speed. Since the barcode is a linear one-dimensional image, it is only necessary to have a higher resolution in one direction and a lower resolution in the other direction. Note: This function performs horizontal and vertical scanning, so you can use a window with a width of 40/80/160 and a length of 480. Finally, be sure to adjust the lens so that the bar code is positioned where the focal length produces the sharpest image. Fuzzy barcodes cannot be decoded.

This function supports all 1D barcodes:

Search can be used for image.SEARCH_DS or image.SEARCH_EX. image.SEARCH_DS The algorithm used for searching templates is faster than image.SEARCH_EX, but if the template is around the edges of the image, it may not be searched successfully. image.SEARCH_EX performs a more detailed search of the image, but it runs much faster than image.SEARCH_DS .

Only grayscale images are supported.

#### image.find_features(cascade[, threshold=0.5[, scale=1.5[, roi]]])

Cascade is a Haar Cascade object. See image.HaarCascade() for more information.

Threshold is a floating point number (0.0-1.0), where a smaller value increases the detection rate while increasing the false positive rate. Conversely, a higher value reduces the detection rate while reducing the false positive rate.

Scale is a floating point number that must be greater than 1.0. A higher scale factor runs faster, but its image matching is poorer. The ideal value is between 1.35 and 1.5.

Threshold is a number that controls the number of extractions (values ​​0-255). For the default AGAST corner detector, this value should be around 20. For the FAST corner detector, this value is approximately 60-80. The lower the threshold, the more corner points you extract.

Normalized is a boolean value. If True, close the extraction keypoint at multiple resolutions. If you don't care about handling extensions and want the algorithm to run faster, set it to True.

Scale_factor is a floating point number that must be greater than 1.0. A higher scale factor runs faster, but its image matching is poorer. The ideal value is between 1.35 and 1.5.

Max_keypoints is the maximum number of key points a keypoint object can hold. If the key point object is too large and causes memory problems, lower the value.

Corner_detector is the corner detector algorithm used to extract key points from an image. Can be image.CORNER_FAST or image.CORNER_AGAST . The FAST corner detector runs faster, but with less accuracy.
