A project that supports MCU routine operations and integrates machine vision and microphone arrays to quickly develop intelligent applications in the AIOT field that are extremely cost effective and practical. MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments. K210 created for AIOT(AI+IOT) use, It's powerful performance and low cost are very competitive. Micropython makes programming on K210 hardware easier, the code is open source and can be found on GitHub) For example if we want to find an I2C device, we just need this code: from machine import I2C i2c = I2C(I2C.I2C0, freq=100000, scl=28, sda=29) devices = i2c.scan() print(devices) Again, if we want to make a breathing light using PWM, we just need this code: from machine import Timer,PWM import time tim = Timer(Timer.TIMER0, Timer.CHANNEL0, mode=Timer.MODE_PWM) ch = PWM(tim, freq=500000, duty=50, pin=board_info.LED_G) duty=0 dir = True while True: if dir: duty += 10 else: duty -= 10 if duty>100: duty = 100 dir = False elif duty To take a picture： import sensor import image import lcd lcd.init() sensor.reset() sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565) sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA) sensor.run(1) while True: img=sensor.snapshot() lcd.display(img) About this documentation Everything related to MaixPy, mainly about How to choose and get a suitable module/development board How to get started with MaixPy, even if you are not an expert in hardware programming.

If you're buying from the official Taobao store, you can ask them to include it with your order. Type-C cables are also very common with Android phones. Screen By default, the LCD (24-pin interface) of the st7789 driver chip is used with a resolution of 320x240. If you're buying from the official Taobao store, you can ask them to include it with your order. Camera MaixPy devices support the ov2640 camera by default, and are often bundled with Maix devices. The ov2640 cameras bundled with Maix device are typically offered with two different lens options; a larger focusable fisheye lens, or a smaller fixed-focus lens. If you're buying from the official Taobao store, you can order a specific camera with your order. Micro SD Card (TF Card) (optional) Some Flash memory within the the device is reserved for a file system, but this internal memory is very slow! For quicker operation and additional storage, you can insert a Micro SD card or a TF card into the card slot available on most Maix devices. When purchasing a memory card, try to choose a new fast Micro SD card, such as a SD 2 generation protocol, Class10 memory card. Of course, the quality of SD cards on the market is uneven, and the SPI mode may not be compatible. Try to buy a regular card. Or maybe you should customize the driver code ~~ As shown below, the two cards on the left are not supported by the MaixPy driver. Both the middle and the right cards are supported, but the class10 card in the middle is the fastest. ST-Link (used to update the firmware of the STM32 on the development board Maix Go) (optional) If you purchase a Maix Go, it has an embedded STM32 chip to simulate the USB-to-Serial converter, as well as JTAG. If you want to upgrade its firmware later on, it is recommended to buy an ST-Link programmer. JTAG Debugger (optional) The K210 chip supports JTAG debugging. If you need to debug, you will need to use the JTAG debugger. Please check the Sipeed Taobao store or SeeedStudio.com to buy one. If you are using a Maix Go development board, you won't need to purchase the JTAG debugger separately as it has an integrated STM32 chip that can emulate JTAG (STM32 uses CMSIS-DAP or open-ec firmware). open-ec firmware is currently not supported, although support will be added later. Please refer to the open-ec GitHub project page for more information. "},"get_started/upgrade_firmware.html":{"url":"get_started/upgrade_firmware.html","title":"Upgrade the firmware","keywords":"","body":"Upgrade MaixPy firmware Connecting the board Connect the Type C cable, one end to the development board, one end to the computer. Install the driver We need to install the serial port driver as the board is connected to the computer through the USB to serial converter. Install the driver according to the board's USB to serial port chip model. In you are using Linux or Mac and you don't want to use sudo every time, add yourself to the dialout users group with the following command: sudo usermod -a -G dialout $(whoami) For Dan Dock or Maix Bit The CH340 chip is being used, Linux does not need to install the driver as the system already comes with it. Execute ls /dev/ttyUSB* to check if the device is found. If using Windows, search and download the drivers on the Internet, then open Device manager and look if the serial port is listed. For Maix Go An STM32 is being used to implement the serial port and the JTAG functionality. By default, this STM32 chip is running a build of the open-ec firmware. If everything is right, one or two serial ports will appear. In linux the following two serial ports will appear: /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1. Please use /dev/ttyUSB1 when downloading and accessing the serial port. Windows is similar. If you need to re-burn this firmware, you can download it from GitHub or open-ec firmware, then use the STM32's SW pins (GND, SWDIO, SWCLK) from the ST-LINK connection board for programming. (The STM32 on the current version of the Go board does not support serial port burning. It can only be burned using ST-LINK. Please purchase it if you need it, or use a board with IO simulation such as the Raspberry Pi)) Currently, open-ec cannot simulate JTAG to debug the board. Use CMSIS-DAP to do so. You can download it from the official website and then burn it using an ST-LINK. Afterwards, /dev/ttyACM0 will appear under linux. ST-LINK has a very complete description of the burning method of STM32, please search for yourself. Please note that updating the firmware of STM32 is not the same as updating the MaixPy firmware. Generally, you do not need to update the firmware of STM32. The default is enough. STM32 is just a USB to serial port tool! Do not be confused. For the new Maixduino and Maix Bit versions that come with a microphone (using a CH552 chip) For the boards with a CH552 chip, to get the USB serial port, FT2232 drivers need to be installed. Search yourself for FT2232 drivers. In those boards, the JTAG function is not available.

Just like learning all programming languages, learning the hello world is a sacred meaning. It is well known that lighting an LED requires a power supply, a resistor, and an LED bulb. On the Dan Dock development board, there are three LEDs, the lines are as follows: For example, we want to red light, i.e., LED_R connected to the LED, the LED can be seen in FIG positive 3.3V power supply has been connected, so long as we can LED_R LED lighting is low. Before writing the program, we need to know that the corresponding pins of the on-chip peripherals (such as GPIO, I2C, etc.) of the hardware K210 used by MaixPy can be arbitrarily set. The STM32 on-chip peripherals and pin correspondences have been fixed. Some of the pins can be multiplexed, compared to the K210 with greater degrees of freedom. For example, I2C can use Pin11 and Pin12, or can be changed to any other pin. We control the LEDs and need to use GPIO The procedure is as follows: from Maix import GPIO fm.register(board_info.LED_R, fm.fpioa.GPIO0) led_r=GPIO(GPIO.GPIO0,GPIO.OUT) led_r.value(0) We only need to click the lines of the code one by one to the keyboard inside the terminal and press OK to execute.

REPL interface To keep things simple in the previous example, we entered code directly in the terminal at the Maix prompt which was executed immediately upon pressing the Enter key. Such interactive command line interfaces are often referred to as REPL（Read Eval Print Loop). MaixPy's REPL interface operates similar to most other command line interfaces except that the supported syntax is MicroPython While MaixPy's REPL interface is simple and convenient for small tasks, it soon becomes annoying to re-enter your code each time you want to run it. The solution is to save your code to a file, and then execute the file. The remainder of this page describes that process. MaixPy file system MaixPy devices have an internal file system which can access both internal and external memories. During boot, the device will mount any external memory cards formatted with either SPIFFS or FAT file systems, and add them to the internal file system as the /flash or /sd directories respectively. NOTES: SPIFFS cards are by default assigned to 3MB SPIFFS (starting at flash address 0xD00000). When detected at boot, SPIFFS devices automatically appear as the /flash directory within the device's internal file system. Currently the SPIFFS implementation in MaixPy does not support the creation of directories. FAT formatted SD (TF) cards are supported, but FAT32 or exFAT formatted cards are not currently supported. When detected at boot, FAT formatted cards will be automatically mounted and appear as the /sd directory in the device's internal file system. It should be noted that the root directory is only used to mount the SD card or SPIFFS flash card. All other file operations happen in the /flash or /sd directories, as determined by the format of the memory card discovered at boot time. Navigating the file system In MaixPy's REPL interface and in code the following os commands can be used to navigate directories and manage files. Command Description Example os.chdir() changes the current directory os.chdir(\"/flash\") os.listdir() list the files in the current directory os.listdir() os.listdir(path) list the files in another directory os.listdir(\"/sd\") os.getcwd() return the current working directory os.getcwd() os.rename(old_path, new_path) rename a file os.rename(\"./blue.py\", \"./aaah.py\") os.remove(path) remove a file os.remove(\"./herring.py\") For a complete list of os commands refer to the MicroPython documentation Editing and saving files There are a number of ways you can edit and save files described below as Methods A through C Method A: Edit and save files using the pye editor built into MaixPy MaixPy includes a built-in open source editor Micropython Editor(pye) At the REPL interface enter pye(\"hello.py\") to create a file and enter the edit mode. Keyboard shortcuts and other instructions can be found here Enter the following code: print(\"hello maixpy\") When you have finished editing, press Ctrl+S and then press Enter to save, and then press Ctrl+Q to exit the editor. Note : The pye editor has certain requirements of the connected terminal. For intuitive operation the BackSpace key should be configured to send Ctrl+?, otherwise the BackSpace key will function as Ctrl+H (ie: character replacement). Linux users are recommended to use minicom. Use sudo minicom -s to set the reference to the previous tutorial Windows users can use PuTTY which supports Backspace key configuration. Note Typing Shift-Backspace will cause PuTTY to send whichever code isn't configured as the default. Alternatively, Xshell users can use: File → Properties → Terminal → Keyboard, Change the delete and backspace sequences to ASCII 127. Method B: Read files to PC by uPyLoader, then download to board after editing This method uses the uPyLoader utility Download the executable: release Select the serial port and click the Connect button to connect the board The first time you run the software, you need to initialize it. Click File->Init transfer files to complete the initialization. This will create two files in the board, __upload.py and __download.py. Then double click file name to read and edit, then click the save button to download the file to board Method C: Read files to PC by rshell, edit, and then save back to board Install rshell first according to the doc of rshell sudo apt-get install python3-pip sudo pip3 install rshell rshell -p /dev/ttyUSB1 # select board serial Edit file ls /flash edit /flash/boot.py # the editor uses vim commands Execution of documents Once MicroPython files exist on the file system they may be executed using the following methods Method A: Execute using import At MaixPy's REPL interface simply enter: import hello then press Enter The hello.py file will run and should output hello maixpy But be careful, the import command can only be used once. If you want to execute the code more than once, please use Method B below. Method B: Execute using exec() Use exec() in a simple program to execute your file with open(\"hello.py\") as f: exec(f.read()) Method C: Execute using uPyLoader Just select the file, then click the execute button Method D: Execute files locally on PC using ampy ampy run script by command ampy run file_in_PC.py to execute files on PC (file won't transmit to board) "},"get_started/upload_script.html":{"url":"get_started/upload_script.html","title":"Upload the script to the development board","keywords":"","body":"Upload script to development board Earlier we came across the pye(\"filename.py\") command to open an editor that directly edits files in the file system. But slowly we will find that this method is only suitable for changing a small amount of code. When the amount of code is huge or we need to highlight support, it does not apply. We need to write the code on the computer and upload it to the board. There are currently several methods: Uploading scripts using the MaixPy IDE Open the MaixPy IDE and connect to the development board. Edit the file, then in the top Tools menu click Save opened file as boot.py to save the code to the development board's boot.py file. The next time the board is powered on, it will be automatically executed. You can also use the Send file option in the Tools menu to send the file. It will be saved to the development board with the same name. This script can also upload other small files. Uploading and running scripts using the graphical tool uPyLoader uPyLoader is an open source software that allows you to easily connect to MaixPy and upload, download, and execute files, monitor output, and more. Download the executable: release Select the serial port and click the Connect button to connect the board The first time you run the software you will need to initialize it. Click File -> Init transfer files to complete the initialization. This will create two files in the board, __upload.py and __download.py. On the left side select the file you want to upload and click Transfer to upload it to the board's file system. On the right side are the files inside the board, click List files to refresh the file list. To execute the script, simply select the file name and click on Execute. Click on View -> Terminal above to open the terminal to view the runtime output or send a command Using rshell tool Just as widh the linux, use the cp on rshell to copy the file to the development board. First, install rshell: sudo apt-get install python3-pip sudo pip3 install rshell rshell -p /dev/ttyUSB1 # choose the device according to your serial port Then copy file~ ls /flash cp ./test.py /flash/ # copies the file \"text.py\" from the computer to the root directory of the development board You can learn about other features of rshell in its project page. Using the command line tool ampy ampy is an open source, easy-to-use command line tool for uploading, downloading, and executing files. Note that this tool is running on the computer, not on the board. Use ampy --help to view help and information. The ampy run file_in_PC.py command also allows you to run the script directly on the board without uploading it previously. TF card copy After copying it to the TF card, execute import filename in the terminal to run the script.

For MicroPython, it has following attributes: name - string “micropython” version - tuple (major, minor, micro), e.g. (1, 7, 0) This object is the recommended way to distinguish MicroPython from other Python implementations (note that it still may not exist in the very minimal ports). Difference to CPython CPython mandates more attributes for this object, but the actual useful bare minimum is implemented in MicroPython. sys.maxsize Maximum value which a native integer type can hold on the current platform, or maximum value representable by MicroPython integer type, if it’s smaller than platform max value (that is the case for MicroPython ports without long int support). This attribute is useful for detecting “bitness” of a platform (32-bit vs 64-bit, etc.). It’s recommended to not compare this attribute to some value directly, but instead count number of bits in it: bits = 0 v = sys.maxsize while v: bits += 1 v >>= 1 if bits > 32: # 64-bit (or more) platform ... else: # 32-bit (or less) platform # Note that on 32-bit platform, value of bits may be less than 32 # (e.g. 31) due to peculiarities described above, so use \"> 16\", # \"> 32\", \"> 64\" style of comparisons. sys.modules Dictionary of loaded modules. On some ports, it may not include builtin modules. sys.path A mutable list of directories to search for imported modules. sys.platform The platform that MicroPython is running on. For OS/RTOS ports, this is usually an identifier of the OS, e.g. \"linux\". For baremetal ports it is an identifier of a board, e.g. \"pyboard\" for the original MicroPython reference board. It thus can be used to distinguish one board from another. If you need to check whether your program runs on MicroPython (vs other Python implementation), use sys.implementation instead. sys.stderr Standard error stream. sys.stdin Standard input stream. sys.stdout Standard output stream. sys.version Python language version that this implementation conforms to, as a string. sys.version_info Python language version that this implementation conforms to, as a tuple of ints.

For more information, refer to the original CPython documentation: collections. This module implements advanced collection and container types to hold/accumulate various objects. Classes ucollections.deque(iterable, maxlen[, flags]) Deques (double-ended queues) are a list-like container that support O(1) appends and pops from either side of the deque. New deques are created using the following arguments: iterable must be the empty tuple, and the new deque is created empty. maxlen must be specified and the deque will be bounded to this maximum length. Once the deque is full, any new items added will discard items from the opposite end. The optional flags can be 1 to check for overflow when adding items. As well as supporting bool and len, deque objects have the following methods: deque.append(x) Add x to the right side of the deque.

The idea behind it is similar to CPython’s ctypes modules, but the actual API is different, streamlined and optimized for small size.

Warning uctypes module allows access to arbitrary memory addresses of the machine (including I/O and control registers). Uncareful usage of it may lead to crashes, data loss, and even hardware malfunction.

Subset of STM32F4xx WWDG block WWDG_LAYOUT = { \"WWDG_CR\": (0, { # BFUINT32 here means size of the WWDG_CR register \"WDGA\": 7 Defining structure layout Structure layout is defined by a “descriptor” - a Python dictionary which encodes field names as keys and other properties required to access them as associated values: { \"field1\": , \"field2\": , ... } Currently, uctypes requires explicit specification of offsets for each field. Offset are given in bytes from the structure start. Following are encoding examples for various field types: Scalar types: \"field_name\": offset | uctypes.UINT32 in other words, the value is a scalar type identifier ORed with a field offset (in bytes) from the start of the structure. Recursive structures: \"sub\": (offset, { \"b0\": 0 | uctypes.UINT8, \"b1\": 1 | uctypes.UINT8, }) i.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is an offset, and second is a structure descriptor dictionary (note: offsets in recursive descriptors are relative to the structure it defines). Of course, recursive structures can be specified not just by a literal dictionary, but by referring to a structure descriptor dictionary (defined earlier) by name. Arrays of primitive types: \"arr\": (offset | uctypes.ARRAY, size | uctypes.UINT8), i.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is ARRAY flag ORed with offset, and second is scalar element type ORed number of elements in the array. Arrays of aggregate types: \"arr2\": (offset | uctypes.ARRAY, size, {\"b\": 0 | uctypes.UINT8}), i.e. value is a 3-tuple, first element of which is ARRAY flag ORed with offset, second is a number of elements in the array, and third is a descriptor of element type. Pointer to a primitive type: \"ptr\": (offset | uctypes.PTR, uctypes.UINT8), i.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is PTR flag ORed with offset, and second is a scalar element type. Pointer to an aggregate type: \"ptr2\": (offset | uctypes.PTR, {\"b\": 0 | uctypes.UINT8}), i.e. value is a 2-tuple, first element of which is PTR flag ORed with offset, second is a descriptor of type pointed to. Bitfields: \"bitf0\": offset | uctypes.BFUINT16 | lsbit i.e. value is a type of scalar value containing given bitfield (typenames are similar to scalar types, but prefixes with BF), ORed with offset for scalar value containing the bitfield, and further ORed with values for bit position and bit length of the bitfield within the scalar value, shifted by BF_POS and BF_LEN bits, respectively. A bitfield position is counted from the least significant bit of the scalar (having position of 0), and is the number of right-most bit of a field (in other words, it’s a number of bits a scalar needs to be shifted right to extract the bitfield). In the example above, first a UINT16 value will be extracted at offset 0 (this detail may be important when accessing hardware registers, where particular access size and alignment are required), and then bitfield whose rightmost bit is lsbit bit of this UINT16, and length is bitsize bits, will be extracted. For example, if lsbit is 0 and bitsize is 8, then effectively it will access least-significant byte of UINT16. Note that bitfield operations are independent of target byte endianness, in particular, example above will access least-significant byte of UINT16 in both little- and big-endian structures. But it depends on the least significant bit being numbered 0. Some targets may use different numbering in their native ABI, but uctypes always uses the normalized numbering described above. Module contents class uctypes.struct(addr, descriptor, layout_type=NATIVE) Instantiate a “foreign data structure” object based on structure address in memory, descriptor (encoded as a dictionary), and layout type (see below). uctypes.LITTLE_ENDIAN Layout type for a little-endian packed structure. (Packed means that every field occupies exactly as many bytes as defined in the descriptor, i.e. the alignment is 1). uctypes.BIG_ENDIAN Layout type for a big-endian packed structure. uctypes.NATIVE Layout type for a native structure - with data endianness and alignment conforming to the ABI of the system on which MicroPython runs. uctypes.sizeof(struct, layout_type=NATIVE) Return size of data structure in bytes. The struct argument can be either a structure class or a specific instantiated structure object (or its aggregate field). uctypes.addressof(obj) Return address of an object. Argument should be bytes, bytearray or other object supporting buffer protocol (and address of this buffer is what actually returned). uctypes.bytes_at(addr, size) Capture memory at the given address and size as bytes object. As bytes object is immutable, memory is actually duplicated and copied into bytes object, so if memory contents change later, created object retains original value. uctypes.bytearray_at(addr, size) Capture memory at the given address and size as bytearray object. Unlike bytes_at() function above, memory is captured by reference, so it can be both written too, and you will access current value at the given memory address. uctypes.UINT8 uctypes.INT8 uctypes.UINT16 uctypes.INT16 uctypes.UINT32 uctypes.INT32 uctypes.UINT64 uctypes.INT64 Integer types for structure descriptors. Constants for 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit types are provided, both signed and unsigned. uctypes.FLOAT32 uctypes.FLOAT64 Floating-point types for structure descriptors. uctypes.VOID VOID is an alias for UINT8, and is provided to conviniently define C’s void pointers: (uctypes.PTR, uctypes.VOID). uctypes.PTR uctypes.ARRAY Type constants for pointers and arrays. Note that there is no explicit constant for structures, it’s implicit: an aggregate type without PTR or ARRAY flags is a structure. Structure descriptors and instantiating structure objects Given a structure descriptor dictionary and its layout type, you can instantiate a specific structure instance at a given memory address using uctypes.struct() constructor. Memory address usually comes from following sources: Predefined address, when accessing hardware registers on a baremetal system. Lookup these addresses in datasheet for a particular MCU/SoC. As a return value from a call to some FFI (Foreign Function Interface) function. From uctypes.addressof(), when you want to pass arguments to an FFI function, or alternatively, to access some data for I/O (for example, data read from a file or network socket). Structure objects Structure objects allow accessing individual fields using standard dot notation: my_struct.substruct1.field1. If a field is of scalar type, getting it will produce a primitive value (Python integer or float) corresponding to the value contained in a field. A scalar field can also be assigned to. If a field is an array, its individual elements can be accessed with the standard subscript operator [] - both read and assigned to. If a field is a pointer, it can be dereferenced using [0] syntax (corresponding to C * operator, though [0] works in C too). Subscripting a pointer with other integer values but 0 are also supported, with the same semantics as in C. Summing up, accessing structure fields generally follows the C syntax, except for pointer dereference, when you need to use [0] operator instead of *. Limitations Accessing non-scalar fields leads to allocation of intermediate objects to represent them. This means that special care should be taken to layout a structure which needs to be accessed when memory allocation is disabled (e.g. from an interrupt). The recommendations are: Avoid accessing nested structures. For example, instead of mcu_registers.peripheral_a.register1, define separate layout descriptors for each peripheral, to be accessed as peripheral_a.register1. Or just cache a particular peripheral: peripheral_a = mcu_registers.peripheral_a. If a register consists of multiple bitfields, you would need to cache references to a particular register: reg_a = mcu_registers.peripheral_a.reg_a. Avoid other non-scalar data, like arrays. For example, instead of peripheral_a.register[0] use peripheral_a.register0. Again, an alternative is to cache intermediate values, e.g. register0 = peripheral_a.register[0]. Range of offsets supported by the uctypes module is limited. The exact range supported is considered an implementation detail, and the general suggestion is to split structure definitions to cover from a few kilobytes to a few dozen of kilobytes maximum. In most cases, this is a natural situation anyway, e.g. it doesn’t make sense to define all registers of an MCU (spread over 32-bit address space) in one structure, but rather a peripheral block by peripheral block. In some extreme cases, you may need to split a structure in several parts artificially (e.g. if accessing native data structure with multi-megabyte array in the middle, though that would be a very synthetic case).)

Terminal redirection and duplication uos.dupterm(stream_object, index=0) Duplicate or switch the MicroPython terminal (the REPL) on the given stream-like object. The stream_object argument must implement the readinto() and write() methods. The stream should be in non-blocking mode and readinto() should return None if there is no data available for reading. After calling this function all terminal output is repeated on this stream, and any input that is available on the stream is passed on to the terminal input. The index parameter should be a non-negative integer and specifies which duplication slot is set. A given port may implement more than one slot (slot 0 will always be available) and in that case terminal input and output is duplicated on all the slots that are set. If None is passed as the stream_object then duplication is cancelled on the slot given by index. The function returns the previous stream-like object in the given slot. Filesystem mounting Some ports provide a Virtual Filesystem (VFS) and the ability to mount multiple “real” filesystems within this VFS. Filesystem objects can be mounted at either the root of the VFS, or at a subdirectory that lives in the root. This allows dynamic and flexible configuration of the filesystem that is seen by Python programs. Ports that have this functionality provide the mount() and umount() functions, and possibly various filesystem implementations represented by VFS classes. uos.mount(fsobj, mount_point, *, readonly) Mount the filesystem object fsobj at the location in the VFS given by the mount_point string. fsobj can be a a VFS object that has a mount() method, or a block device. If it’s a block device then the filesystem type is automatically detected (an exception is raised if no filesystem was recognised). mount_point may be '/' to mount fsobj at the root, or '/' to mount it at a subdirectory under the root. If readonly is True then the filesystem is mounted read-only. During the mount process the method mount() is called on the filesystem object. Will raise OSError(EPERM) if mount_point is already mounted. uos.umount(mount_point) Unmount a filesystem. mount_point can be a string naming the mount location, or a previously-mounted filesystem object. During the unmount process the method umount() is called on the filesystem object. Will raise OSError(EINVAL) if mount_point is not found. class uos.VfsFat(block_dev) Create a filesystem object that uses the FAT filesystem format. Storage of the FAT filesystem is provided by block_dev. Objects created by this constructor can be mounted using mount(). static mkfs(block_dev) Build a FAT filesystem on block_dev. Block devices A block device is an object which implements the block protocol, which is a set of methods described below by the AbstractBlockDev class. A concrete implementation of this class will usually allow access to the memory-like functionality a piece of hardware (like flash memory). A block device can be used by a particular filesystem driver to store the data for its filesystem. class uos.AbstractBlockDev(...) Construct a block device object. The parameters to the constructor are dependent on the specific block device. readblocks(block_num, buf) Starting at the block given by the index block_num, read blocks from the device into buf (an array of bytes). The number of blocks to read is given by the length of buf, which will be a multiple of the block size. writeblocks(block_num, buf) Starting at the block given by the index block_num, write blocks from buf (an array of bytes) to the device. The number of blocks to write is given by the length of buf, which will be a multiple of the block size. ioctl(op, arg) Control the block device and query its parameters. The operation to perform is given by op which is one of the following integers: 1 – initialise the device (arg is unused) 2 – shutdown the device (arg is unused) 3 – sync the device (arg is unused) 4 – get a count of the number of blocks, should return an integer (arg is unused) 5 – get the number of bytes in a block, should return an integer, or None in which case the default value of 512 is used (arg is unused) By way of example, the following class will implement a block device that stores its data in RAM using a bytearray: class RAMBlockDev: def __init__(self, block_size, num_blocks): self.block_size = block_size self.data = bytearray(block_size * num_blocks) def readblocks(self, block_num, buf): for i in range(len(buf)): buf[i] = self.data[block_num * self.block_size + i] def writeblocks(self, block_num, buf): for i in range(len(buf)): self.data[block_num * self.block_size + i] = buf[i] def ioctl(self, op, arg): if op == 4: # get number of blocks return len(self.data) // self.block_size if op == 5: # get block size return self.block_size It can be used as follows: import uos bdev = RAMBlockDev(512, 50) uos.VfsFat.mkfs(bdev) vfs = uos.VfsFat(bdev) uos.mount(vfs, '/ramdisk') "},"libs/standard/ure.html":{"url":"libs/standard/ure.html","title":"ure","keywords":"","body":"ure – simple regular expressions This module implements a subset of the corresponding CPython module, as described below.

Supported operators and special sequences . : Match any character. [...] : Match set of characters. Individual characters and ranges are supported, including negated sets (e.g. [^a-c]). ^ : Match the start of the string. $ : Match the end of the string. ? : Match zero or one of the previous sub-pattern. * : Match zero or more of the previous sub-pattern. + : Match one or more of the previous sub-pattern. ?? : Non-greedy version of ?, match zero or one, with the preference for zero. *? : Non-greedy version of *, match zero or more, with the preference for the shortest match. +? : Non-greedy version of +, match one or more, with the preference for the shortest match. | : Match either the left-hand side or the right-hand side sub-patterns of this operator. (...) : Grouping. Each group is capturing (a substring it captures can be accessed with match.group() method). \\d : Matches digit. Equivalent to [0-9]. \\D : Matches non-digit. Equivalent to [^0-9]. \\s : Matches whitespace. Equivalent to [ \\t-\\r]. \\S : Matches non-whitespace. Equivalent to [^ \\t-\\r]. \\w : Matches “word characters” (ASCII only). Equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_]. \\W : Matches non “word characters” (ASCII only). Equivalent to [^A-Za-z0-9_]. \\ : Escape character. Any other character following the backslash, except for those listed above, is taken literally. For example, \\* is equivalent to literal * (not treated as the * operator). Note that \\r, \\n, etc. are not handled specially, and will be equivalent to literal letters r, n, etc. Due to this, it’s not recommended to use raw Python strings (r\"\") for regular expressions. For example, r\"\\r\\n\" when used as the regular expression is equivalent to \"rn\". To match CR character followed by LF, use \"\\r\\n\". NOT SUPPORTED: counted repetitions ({m,n}) named groups ((?P...)) non-capturing groups ((?:...)) more advanced assertions (\\b, \\B) special character escapes like \\r, \\n - use Python’s own escaping instead etc. Example: import ure # As ure doesn't support escapes itself, use of r\"\" strings is not # recommended. regex = ure.compile(\"[\\r\\n]\") regex.split(\"line1\\rline2\\nline3\\r\\n\") # Result: # ['line1', 'line2', 'line3', '', ''] Functions ure.compile(regex_str[, flags]) Compile regular expression, return regex object. ure.match(regex_str, string) Compile regex_str and match against string. Match always happens from starting position in a string. ure.search(regex_str, string) Compile regex_str and search it in a string. Unlike match, this will search string for first position which matches regex (which still may be 0 if regex is anchored). ure.sub(regex_str, replace, string, count=0, flags=0) Compile regex_str and search for it in string, replacing all matches with replace, and returning the new string. replace can be a string or a function. If it is a string then escape sequences of the form \\ and \\g can be used to expand to the corresponding group (or an empty string for unmatched groups). If replace is a function then it must take a single argument (the match) and should return a replacement string. If count is specified and non-zero then substitution will stop after this many substitutions are made. The flags argument is ignored.

If max_split is given, it specifies maximum number of splits to perform. Returns list of strings (there may be up to max_split+1 elements if it’s specified). Match objects Match objects as returned by match() and search() methods, and passed to the replacement function in sub(). match.group(index) Return matching (sub)string. index is 0 for entire match, 1 and above for each capturing group. Only numeric groups are supported. match.groups() Return a tuple containing all the substrings of the groups of the match. Note: availability of this method depends on MicroPython port. match.start([index]) match.end([index]) Return the index in the original string of the start or end of the substring group that was matched. index defaults to the entire group, otherwise it will select a group.

For more information, refer to the original CPython documentation: socket. This module provides access to the BSD socket interface. Difference to CPython For efficiency and consistency, socket objects in MicroPython implement a stream (file-like) interface directly. In CPython, you need to convert a socket to a file-like object using makefile() method. This method is still supported by MicroPython (but is a no-op), so where compatibility with CPython matters, be sure to use it. Socket address format(s) The native socket address format of the usocket module is an opaque data type returned by getaddrinfo function, which must be used to resolve textual address (including numeric addresses): sockaddr = usocket.getaddrinfo('www.micropython.org', 80)[0][-1] # You must use getaddrinfo() even for numeric addresses sockaddr = usocket.getaddrinfo('127.0.0.1', 80)[0][-1] # Now you can use that address sock.connect(addr) Using getaddrinfo is the most efficient (both in terms of memory and processing power) and portable way to work with addresses. However, socket module (note the difference with native MicroPython usocket module described here) provides CPython-compatible way to specify addresses using tuples, as described below. Note that depending on a MicroPython port, socket module can be builtin or need to be installed from micropython-lib (as in the case of MicroPython Unix port), and some ports still accept only numeric addresses in the tuple format, and require to use getaddrinfo function to resolve domain names. Summing up: Always use getaddrinfo when writing portable applications. Tuple addresses described below can be used as a shortcut for quick hacks and interactive use, if your port supports them. Tuple address format for socket module: IPv4: (ipv4_address, port), where ipv4_address is a string with dot-notation numeric IPv4 address, e.g. \"8.8.8.8\", and port is and integer port number in the range 1-65535. Note the domain names are not accepted as ipv4_address, they should be resolved first using usocket.getaddrinfo(). IPv6: (ipv6_address, port, flowinfo, scopeid), where ipv6_address is a string with colon-notation numeric IPv6 address, e.g. \"2001:db8::1\", and port is an integer port number in the range 1-65535. flowinfo must be 0. scopeid is the interface scope identifier for link-local addresses. Note the domain names are not accepted as ipv6_address, they should be resolved first using usocket.getaddrinfo(). Availability of IPv6 support depends on a MicroPython port. Functions usocket.socket(af=AF_INET, type=SOCK_STREAM, proto=IPPROTO_TCP) Create a new socket using the given address family, socket type and protocol number. Note that specifying proto in most cases is not required (and not recommended, as some MicroPython ports may omit IPPROTO_* constants). Instead, type argument will select needed protocol automatically: # Create STREAM TCP socket socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM) # Create DGRAM UDP socket socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM) usocket.getaddrinfo(host, port, af=0, type=0, proto=0, flags=0) Translate the host/port argument into a sequence of 5-tuples that contain all the necessary arguments for creating a socket connected to that service. Arguments af, type, and proto (which have the same meaning as for the socket() function) can be used to filter which kind of addresses are returned. If a parameter is not specified or zero, all combinations of addresses can be returned (requiring filtering on the user side). The resulting list of 5-tuples has the following structure: (family, type, proto, canonname, sockaddr) The following example shows how to connect to a given url: s = usocket.socket() # This assumes that if \"type\" is not specified, an address for # SOCK_STREAM will be returned, which may be not true s.connect(usocket.getaddrinfo('www.micropython.org', 80)[0][-1]) Recommended use of filtering params: s = usocket.socket() # Guaranteed to return an address which can be connect'ed to for # stream operation. s.connect(usocket.getaddrinfo('www.micropython.org', 80, 0, SOCK_STREAM)[0][-1]) Difference to CPython CPython raises a socket.gaierror exception (OSError subclass) in case of error in this function. MicroPython doesn’t have socket.gaierror and raises OSError directly. Note that error numbers of getaddrinfo() form a separate namespace and may not match error numbers from the uerrno module. To distinguish getaddrinfo() errors, they are represented by negative numbers, whereas standard system errors are positive numbers (error numbers are accessible using e.args[0] property from an exception object). The use of negative values is a provisional detail which may change in the future. usocket.inet_ntop(af, bin_addr) Convert a binary network address bin_addr of the given address family af to a textual representation: >>> usocket.inet_ntop(usocket.AF_INET, b\"\\x7f\\0\\0\\1\") '127.0.0.1' usocket.inet_pton(af, txt_addr) Convert a textual network address txt_addr of the given address family af to a binary representation: >>> usocket.inet_pton(usocket.AF_INET, \"1.2.3.4\") b'\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04' Constants usocket.AF_INET usocket.AF_INET6 Address family types. Availability depends on a particular MicroPython port. usocket.SOCK_STREAM usocket.SOCK_DGRAM Socket types. usocket.IPPROTO_UDP usocket.IPPROTO_TCP IP protocol numbers. Availability depends on a particular MicroPython port. Note that you don’t need to specify these in a call to usocket.socket(), because SOCK_STREAM socket type automatically selects IPPROTO_TCP, and SOCK_DGRAM - IPPROTO_UDP. Thus, the only real use of these constants is as an argument to setsockopt(). usocket.SOL_* Socket option levels (an argument to setsockopt()). The exact inventory depends on a MicroPython port. usocket.SO_* Socket options (an argument to setsockopt()). The exact inventory depends on a MicroPython port. Constants specific to WiPy: usocket.IPPROTO_SEC Special protocol value to create SSL-compatible socket. class socket Methods socket.close() Mark the socket closed and release all resources. Once that happens, all future operations on the socket object will fail. The remote end will receive EOF indication if supported by protocol. Sockets are automatically closed when they are garbage-collected, but it is recommended to close() them explicitly as soon you finished working with them. socket.bind(address) Bind the socket to address. The socket must not already be bound. socket.listen([backlog]) Enable a server to accept connections. If backlog is specified, it must be at least 0 (if it’s lower, it will be set to 0); and specifies the number of unaccepted connections that the system will allow before refusing new connections. If not specified, a default reasonable value is chosen. socket.accept() Accept a connection. The socket must be bound to an address and listening for connections. The return value is a pair (conn, address) where conn is a new socket object usable to send and receive data on the connection, and address is the address bound to the socket on the other end of the connection. socket.connect(address) Connect to a remote socket at address. socket.send(bytes) Send data to the socket. The socket must be connected to a remote socket. Returns number of bytes sent, which may be smaller than the length of data (“short write”). socket.sendall(bytes) Send all data to the socket. The socket must be connected to a remote socket. Unlike send(), this method will try to send all of data, by sending data chunk by chunk consecutively. The behavior of this method on non-blocking sockets is undefined. Due to this, on MicroPython, it’s recommended to use write() method instead, which has the same “no short writes” policy for blocking sockets, and will return number of bytes sent on non-blocking sockets. socket.recv(bufsize) Receive data from the socket. The return value is a bytes object representing the data received. The maximum amount of data to be received at once is specified by bufsize. socket.sendto(bytes, address) Send data to the socket. The socket should not be connected to a remote socket, since the destination socket is specified by address. socket.recvfrom(bufsize) Receive data from the socket. The return value is a pair (bytes, address) where bytes is a bytes object representing the data received and address is the address of the socket sending the data. socket.setsockopt(level, optname, value) Set the value of the given socket option. The needed symbolic constants are defined in the socket module (SO_* etc.). The value can be an integer or a bytes-like object representing a buffer. socket.settimeout(value) Note: Not every port supports this method, see below. Set a timeout on blocking socket operations. The value argument can be a nonnegative floating point number expressing seconds, or None. If a non-zero value is given, subsequent socket operations will raise an OSError exception if the timeout period value has elapsed before the operation has completed. If zero is given, the socket is put in non-blocking mode. If None is given, the socket is put in blocking mode. Not every MicroPython port supports this method. A more portable and generic solution is to use uselect.poll object. This allows to wait on multiple objects at the same time (and not just on sockets, but on generic stream objects which support polling). Example: # Instead of: s.settimeout(1.0) # time in seconds s.read(10) # may timeout # Use: poller = uselect.poll() poller.register(s, uselect.POLLIN) res = poller.poll(1000) # time in milliseconds if not res: # s is still not ready for input, i.e. operation timed out Difference to CPython CPython raises a socket.timeout exception in case of timeout, which is an OSError subclass. MicroPython raises an OSError directly instead. If you use except OSError: to catch the exception, your code will work both in MicroPython and CPython. socket.setblocking(flag) Set blocking or non-blocking mode of the socket: if flag is false, the socket is set to non-blocking, else to blocking mode. This method is a shorthand for certain settimeout() calls: sock.setblocking(True) is equivalent to sock.settimeout(None) sock.setblocking(False) is equivalent to sock.settimeout(0) socket.makefile(mode='rb', buffering=0) Return a file object associated with the socket. The exact returned type depends on the arguments given to makefile(). The support is limited to binary modes only (‘rb’, ‘wb’, and ‘rwb’). CPython’s arguments: encoding, errors and newline are not supported. Difference to CPython As MicroPython doesn’t support buffered streams, values of buffering parameter is ignored and treated as if it was 0 (unbuffered). Difference to CPython Closing the file object returned by makefile() WILL close the original socket as well. socket.read([size]) Read up to size bytes from the socket. Return a bytes object. If size is not given, it reads all data available from the socket until EOF; as such the method will not return until the socket is closed. This function tries to read as much data as requested (no “short reads”). This may be not possible with non-blocking socket though, and then less data will be returned. socket.readinto(buf[, nbytes]) Read bytes into the buf. If nbytes is specified then read at most that many bytes. Otherwise, read at most len(buf) bytes. Just as read(), this method follows “no short reads” policy. Return value: number of bytes read and stored into buf. socket.readline() Read a line, ending in a newline character. Return value: the line read. socket.write(buf) Write the buffer of bytes to the socket. This function will try to write all data to a socket (no “short writes”). This may be not possible with a non-blocking socket though, and returned value will be less than the length of buf. Return value: number of bytes written. exception usocket.error MicroPython does NOT have this exception. Difference to CPython CPython used to have a socket.error exception which is now deprecated, and is an alias of OSError. In MicroPython, use OSError directly.

"},"libs/standard/utime.html":{"url":"libs/standard/utime.html","title":"utime","keywords":"","body":"utime – time related functions This module implements a subset of the corresponding CPython module, as described below. For more information, refer to the original CPython documentation: time. The utime module provides functions for getting the current time and date, measuring time intervals, and for delays. Time Epoch: Unix port uses standard for POSIX systems epoch of 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. However, embedded ports use epoch of 2000-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Maintaining actual calendar date/time: This requires a Real Time Clock (RTC). On systems with underlying OS (including some RTOS), an RTC may be implicit. Setting and maintaining actual calendar time is responsibility of OS/RTOS and is done outside of MicroPython, it just uses OS API to query date/time. On baremetal ports however system time depends on machine.RTC() object. The current calendar time may be set using machine.RTC().datetime(tuple) function, and maintained by following means: By a backup battery (which may be an additional, optional component for a particular board). Using networked time protocol (requires setup by a port/user). Set manually by a user on each power-up (many boards then maintain RTC time across hard resets, though some may require setting it again in such case). If actual calendar time is not maintained with a system/MicroPython RTC, functions below which require reference to current absolute time may behave not as expected. Functions utime.localtime([secs]) Convert a time expressed in seconds since the Epoch (see above) into an 8-tuple which contains: (year, month, mday, hour, minute, second, weekday, yearday) If secs is not provided or None, then the current time from the RTC is used. year includes the century (for example 2014). month is 1-12 mday is 1-31 hour is 0-23 minute is 0-59 second is 0-59 weekday is 0-6 for Mon-Sun yearday is 1-366 utime.mktime() This is inverse function of localtime. It’s argument is a full 8-tuple which expresses a time as per localtime. It returns an integer which is the number of seconds since Jan 1, 2000. utime.sleep(seconds) Sleep for the given number of seconds. Some boards may accept seconds as a floating-point number to sleep for a fractional number of seconds. Note that other boards may not accept a floating-point argument, for compatibility with them use sleep_ms() and sleep_us() functions. utime.sleep_ms(ms) Delay for given number of milliseconds, should be positive or 0. utime.sleep_us(us) Delay for given number of microseconds, should be positive or 0. utime.ticks_ms() Returns an increasing millisecond counter with an arbitrary reference point, that wraps around after some value. The wrap-around value is not explicitly exposed, but we will refer to it as TICKS_MAX to simplify discussion. Period of the values is TICKS_PERIOD = TICKS_MAX + 1. TICKS_PERIOD is guaranteed to be a power of two, but otherwise may differ from port to port. The same period value is used for all of ticks_ms(), ticks_us(), ticks_cpu() functions (for simplicity). Thus, these functions will return a value in range [0 .. TICKS_MAX], inclusive, total TICKS_PERIOD values. Note that only non-negative values are used. For the most part, you should treat values returned by these functions as opaque. The only operations available for them are ticks_diff() and ticks_add() functions described below. Note: Performing standard mathematical operations (+, -) or relational operators (, >=) directly on these value will lead to invalid result. Performing mathematical operations and then passing their results as arguments to ticks_diff() or ticks_add() will also lead to invalid results from the latter functions. utime.ticks_us() Just like ticks_ms() above, but in microseconds. utime.ticks_cpu() Similar to ticks_ms() and ticks_us(), but with the highest possible resolution in the system. This is usually CPU clocks, and that’s why the function is named that way. But it doesn’t have to be a CPU clock, some other timing source available in a system (e.g. high-resolution timer) can be used instead. The exact timing unit (resolution) of this function is not specified on utime module level, but documentation for a specific port may provide more specific information. This function is intended for very fine benchmarking or very tight real-time loops. Avoid using it in portable code. Availability: Not every port implements this function. utime.ticks_add(ticks, delta) Offset ticks value by a given number, which can be either positive or negative. Given a ticks value, this function allows to calculate ticks value delta ticks before or after it, following modular-arithmetic definition of tick values (see ticks_ms() above). ticks parameter must be a direct result of call to ticks_ms(), ticks_us(), or ticks_cpu() functions (or from previous call to ticks_add()). However, delta can be an arbitrary integer number or numeric expression. ticks_add() is useful for calculating deadlines for events/tasks. (Note: you must use ticks_diff() function to work with deadlines.) Examples: # Find out what ticks value there was 100ms ago print(ticks_add(time.ticks_ms(), -100)) # Calculate deadline for operation and test for it deadline = ticks_add(time.ticks_ms(), 200) while ticks_diff(deadline, time.ticks_ms()) > 0: do_a_little_of_something() # Find out TICKS_MAX used by this port print(ticks_add(0, -1)) utime.ticks_diff(ticks1, ticks2) Measure ticks difference between values returned from ticks_ms(), ticks_us(), or ticks_cpu() functions, as a signed value which may wrap around. The argument order is the same as for subtraction operator, ticks_diff(ticks1, ticks2) has the same meaning as ticks1 - ticks2. However, values returned by ticks_ms(), etc. functions may wrap around, so directly using subtraction on them will produce incorrect result. That is why ticks_diff() is needed, it implements modular (or more specifically, ring) arithmetics to produce correct result even for wrap-around values (as long as they not too distant inbetween, see below). The function returns signed value in the range [-TICKS_PERIOD/2 .. TICKS_PERIOD/2-1] (that’s a typical range definition for two’s-complement signed binary integers). If the result is negative, it means that ticks1 occurred earlier in time than ticks2. Otherwise, it means that ticks1 occurred after ticks2. This holds only if ticks1 and ticks2 are apart from each other for no more than TICKS_PERIOD/2-1 ticks. If that does not hold, incorrect result will be returned. Specifically, if two tick values are apart for TICKS_PERIOD/2-1 ticks, that value will be returned by the function. However, if TICKS_PERIOD/2 of real-time ticks has passed between them, the function will return -TICKS_PERIOD/2 instead, i.e. result value will wrap around to the negative range of possible values. Informal rationale of the constraints above: Suppose you are locked in a room with no means to monitor passing of time except a standard 12-notch clock. Then if you look at dial-plate now, and don’t look again for another 13 hours (e.g., if you fall for a long sleep), then once you finally look again, it may seem to you that only 1 hour has passed. To avoid this mistake, just look at the clock regularly. Your application should do the same. “Too long sleep” metaphor also maps directly to application behavior: don’t let your application run any single task for too long. Run tasks in steps, and do time-keeping inbetween. ticks_diff() is designed to accommodate various usage patterns, among them: Polling with timeout. In this case, the order of events is known, and you will deal only with positive results of ticks_diff(): # Wait for GPIO pin to be asserted, but at most 500us start = time.ticks_us() while pin.value() == 0: if time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_us(), start) > 500: raise TimeoutError Scheduling events. In this case, ticks_diff() result may be negative if an event is overdue: # This code snippet is not optimized now = time.ticks_ms() scheduled_time = task.scheduled_time() if ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) > 0: print(\"Too early, let's nap\") sleep_ms(ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now)) task.run() elif ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) == 0: print(\"Right at time!\") task.run() elif ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) Note: Do not pass time() values to ticks_diff(), you should use normal mathematical operations on them. But note that time() may (and will) also overflow. This is known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem . utime.time() Returns the number of seconds, as an integer, since the Epoch, assuming that underlying RTC is set and maintained as described above. If an RTC is not set, this function returns number of seconds since a port-specific reference point in time (for embedded boards without a battery-backed RTC, usually since power up or reset). If you want to develop portable MicroPython application, you should not rely on this function to provide higher than second precision. If you need higher precision, use ticks_ms() and ticks_us()functions, if you need calendar time, localtime() without an argument is a better choice. Difference to CPython In CPython, this function returns number of seconds since Unix epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC, as a floating-point, usually having microsecond precision. With MicroPython, only Unix port uses the same Epoch, and if floating-point precision allows, returns sub-second precision. Embedded hardware usually doesn’t have floating-point precision to represent both long time ranges and subsecond precision, so they use integer value with second precision. Some embedded hardware also lacks battery-powered RTC, so returns number of seconds since last power-up or from other relative, hardware-specific point (e.g. reset).

Functions decompress uzlib.decompress(data, wbits=0, bufsize=0) Return decompressed data as bytes. wbits is DEFLATE dictionary window size used during compression (8-15, the dictionary size is power of 2 of that value). Additionally, if value is positive, data is assumed to be zlib stream (with zlib header). Otherwise, if it’s negative, it’s assumed to be raw DEFLATE stream. bufsize parameter is for compatibility with CPython and is ignored.

There is also a separate TF plug-in module. ESP8285_Module network.ESP8285(uart) Instantiate an ESP8285 NIC object, passing in an uart object. On the dock and GO currently supported by MaixPy, use the AT command module as WiFi. So the uart object is the object that communicates with the AT module, you can view the uart module routine. Calling this method will initialize ESP8285, throwing an exception if it fails. Parameters uart: UART object that communicates with the AT module Return Value ESP8285: NIC object ESP8285 connect(ssid, key) Connect to a hotspot (AP/router). Parameters ssid: hotspot SSID key: password for hotspot Return Value None. An exception will be thrown if an error occurs. 2.2. ifconfig Display the current WiFi connection information. Currently, the network does not support setting the network card configuration. nic.ifconfig() Parameters None Return Value tuple type, the elements are all strings: (ip, netmask, gateway, dns_server, dhcp_server, mac, ssid), if not queried or invalid, the value is `\"0\". isconnected Check if WiFi is connected. nic.isconnected() Parameters None Return Value True: Already connected False: Disconnected disconnect Disconnect WiFi. Parameters None Return Value None scan Scan for surrounding WiFi hotspots. Parameters None Return Value A list object, each element containing a string, the string comes from the response of the AT module, the content is the same as described in esp8285 AT directive document, as follows: ',,,,,,,, ,,' : encryption method 0: OPEN 1: WEP 2: WPA_PSK 3: WPA2_PSK 4: WPA_WPA2_PSK 5: WPA2_Enterprise (current AT does not support connection to this encrypted AP) : string parameter, SSID of AP : signal strength : string parameter, AP's MAC address : channel number : AP frequency offset, unit: kHz. This value is divided by 2.4 to get the ppm value. : frequency offset calibration value : 0: CIPHER_NONE 1: CIPHER_WEP40 2: CIPHER_WEP104 3: CIPHER_TKIP 4: CIPHER_CCMP 5: CIPHER_TKIP_CCMP 6: CIPHER_UNKNOWN : definition is the same as : bit0 stands for b mode; bit1 stands for g mode; bit2 stands for n mode If the corresponding bit is 1, it indicates that the mode is enabled; if the corresponding bit is 0, the mode is not enabled. :0, WPS is not enabled; 1, WPS is enabled example: info_strs = ['4,\"ChinaNet-lot0\",-79,\"c8:50:e9:e8:21:3e\",1,-42,0,4,3,7,1', '4,\"TOPSTEP2G4\",-7 0,\"f8:e7:1e:0d:0d:f8\",1,-57,0,4,4,7,0'] This may seem strange, because each AP's information is a string of characters, there are integers and strings in the message, the string is enclosed in double quotes, so you need to deal with it again after getting this string, for example: def wifi_deal_ap_info(info): res = [] for ap_str in info: ap_str = ap_str.split(\",\") info_one = [] for node in ap_str: if node.startswith('\"'): info_one.append(node[1:-1]) else: info_one.append(int(node)) res.append(info_one) return res info_strs = ['4,\"ChinaNet-lot0\",-79,\"c8:50:e9:e8:21:3e\",1,-42,0,4,3,7,1', '4,\"TOPSTEP2G4\",-70,\"f8:e7:1e:0d:0d:f8\",1,-57,0,4,4,7,0'] info = wifi_deal_ap_info(info_strs) print(info) The output is: [[4, 'ChinaNet-lot0', -79, 'c8:50:e9:e8:21:3e', 1, -42, 0, 4, 3, 7, 1], [4, 'TOPSTEP2G4', -70, 'f8:e7:1e:0d:0d:f8', 1, -57, 0, 4, 4, 7, 0]] Then for example to get every AP SSID: for ap_info in info: print(ap_info[1]) enable_ap(ssid, key, chl=5, ecn=3) Connect to the specified WiFi hotspot.

RGB888 refers to 8 bits (0-255) of red, green and blue. In LAB, L has a value range of 0-100, and a/b ranges from -128 to 127. image.lab_to_rgb(lab_tuple) Returns the tuple (r, g, b) of the RGB888 format corresponding to the tuple lab_tuple (l, a, b) in LAB format. RGB888 refers to 8 bits (0-255) of red, green and blue.

RGB888 refers to 8 bits (0-255) of red, green and blue. The gray value is from 0 to 255. image.grayscale_to_rgb(g_value) Returns the tuple (r, g, b) of the RGB888 format corresponding to the gray value g_value. RGB888 refers to 8 bits (0-255) of red, green and blue. The gray value is from 0 to 255. image.load_decriptor(path) Load a descriptor object from the disk. Path is the path where the descriptor file is saved. image.save_descriptor(path, descriptor) Save the descriptor object descriptor to disk. Path is the path where the descriptor file is saved. image.match_descriptor(descritor0, descriptor1[, threshold=70[, filter_outliers=False]]) For the LBP descriptor, this function returns an integer that represents the difference between the two descriptors. This distance measurement is especially necessary. This distance is a measure of similarity. The closer this measure is to 0, the better the LBPF feature points will match. For the ORB descriptor, this function returns the kptmatch object. See above. Threshold is used to filter the ambiguous matching service for the ORB keypoint. A lower threshold value will be tied to the keypoint matching algorithm. The threshold value is at 0-100 (int). The default is 70. Filter_outliers is used to filter outliers for ORB keypoints. Feature points allow the user to increase the threshold value. The default setting is False. HaarCascade Class – Feature Descriptors The Haar Cascade feature descriptor is used for the image.find_features() method. It has no methods for the user to call. Constructor Class image.HaarCascade(path[, stages=Auto]) Load a Haar Cascade from a Haar Cascade binary (a format suitable for OpenMV Cam). If you pass a \"frontalface\" string instead of a path, this constructor will load a built-in positive face Haar Cascade into memory. In addition, you can also load Haar Cascade into memory via \"eye\". Finally, this method returns the loaded Haar Cascade object, which is used to use image.find_features() . The stage default is the number of stages in Haar Cascade. However, you can specify a lower value to speed up the running of the feature detector, which of course leads to a higher false positive rate. You can make your own Haar Cascades to work with your OpenMV Cam. First, use Google search \" Haar Cascade\" to check if someone has created OpenCV Haar Cascade for the object you want to detect. If not, you need to do it yourself (the amount of work is huge). For information on how to make your own Haar Cascade, see here on how to turn OpenCV Haar Cascades into a mode that your OpenMV Cam can read, see this script Q: What is Haar Cascade? A: Haar Cascade is a series of comparison checks used to determine if an object is present in an image. This series of comparison checks is divided into phases, and the operation of the latter phase is premised on the completion of the previous phase. Contrast checks are not complicated, but are like processes that check if the center of the image is slightly more vertical than the edges. A wide range of inspections are carried out first in the early stages, and more small area inspections are carried out later. Q: How was Haar Cascades made? A: Haar Cascades trains generator algorithms with positive and negative images. For example, use hundreds of pictures containing cats (marked as containing cats) and hundreds of pictures that do not contain cats (have been marked differently) to train this generation algorithm. This generation algorithm will eventually generate a Haar Cascades for detecting cats. Similarity Class – Similarity Object The similarity object is returned by image.get_similarity. Constructor Class image.similarity Call the image.get_similarity() function to create this object. 方法 similarity.mean() Returns the mean of the similarity difference in 8x8 pixel block structure. Range [-1/+1], where -1 is completely different and +1 is identical. You can also get this value via index [0]. similarity.stdev() Returns the standard deviation of the 8x8 pixel block structure similarity difference. You can also get this value via index [1]. similarity.min() Returns the minimum value of the 8x8 pixel block structure similarity difference. Where -1 is completely different and +1 is identical. You can also get this value via index [2]. By looking at this value, you can quickly determine if any 8x8 pixel blocks between the two images are very different, which is much lower than +1. similarity.max() Returns the minimum value of the 8x8 pixel block structure similarity difference. Where -1 is completely different and +1 is identical. You can also get this value via index [3]. By looking at this value, you can quickly determine if any 8x8 pixel blocks between the two images are the same. That is much larger than -1. Histogram Class – Histogram Object The histogram object is returned by image.get_histogram. A grayscale histogram has a channel that contains multiple binaryes. All binaries are normalized to a total of one. RGB565 has three channels with multiple binary. All binaries are normalized to a total of one.

You can also get this value via index [2]. histogram.get_percentile(percentile) Calculates the CDF of the histogram channel, returning a value that passes the histogram in percentile (0.0 - 1.0) (floating point). Therefore, if you pass in 0.1, this method will tell you which binary will cause the accumulator to cross 0.1 when accumulating the accumulator. This is effective for determining the minimum (0.1) and max(0.9) of the color distribution when there is no anomalous utility to corrupt your adaptive color tracking results. histogram.get_threhsold() Use the Otsu’s method to calculate the optimal threshold, dividing each channel of the histogram into two halves. This method returns an image.threshold object. This method is especially useful for determining the best image.binary() threshold. histogram.get_statistics() Calculates the mean, median, value, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, lower quartile, and upper quartile for each color channel in the histogram and returns a statistics object. You can also use histogram.statistics() and histogram.get_stats() as aliases for this method. Percentile Class – Percentage Value Object The percentage value object is returned by histogram.get_percentile. The grayscale value has one channel. Do not use the l* , a , or b_ methods.

The RGB565 threshold has three channels. Use the l*, a, and b_ methods. Constructor Class image.threshold Call the histogram.get_threshold() function to create this object. 方法 threhsold.value() Returns the threshold of the grayscale image (between 0 and 255). You can also get this value via index [0]. threhsold.l_value() Returns the L threshold in RGB565 map LAB (between 0 and 100). You can also get this value via index [0]. threhsold.a_value() Returns the A threshold in the RGB565 graph LAB (between -128 and 127). You can also get this value via index [1]. threhsold.b_value() Returns the B threshold in RGB565 map LAB (between -128 and 127).

ImageWriterClass – ImageWriter Object The ImageWriter object allows you to quickly write uncompressed images to disk. Constructor Class image.ImageWriter(path) Create an ImageWriter object and you can write uncompressed images to disk in a simple file format for OpenMV Cams. The uncompressed image can then be re-read using ImageReader. method imagewriter.size() Returns the size of the file being written. imagewriter.add_frame(img) Write an image to disk. Because the image is not compressed, it performs quickly but takes up a lot of disk space. imagewriter.close() Close the image stream file. You must close the file or the file will be corrupted. ImageReader Class – ImageReader Object The ImageReader object allows you to quickly read uncompressed images from disk. Constructor Class image.ImageReader(path) Create an ImageReader object to play back the image data written by the ImageWriter object.

Imagereader.next_frame([copy_to_fb=True, loop=True]) Returns an image object from a file written by ImageWriter. If copy_to_fb is True, the image object will be loaded directly into the frame buffer. Otherwise the image object will be placed in the heap. Note: Unless the image is small, the heap may not have enough space to store the image object. If loop is True, playback will resume after the last image of the stream has been read. Otherwise, this method will return None after all frames have been read. Note: imagereader.next_frame attempts to limit the playback speed by pausing playback after reading the frame to match the speed of the frame recording. Otherwise, this method will play all images at a speed of 200+FPS. imagereader.close() Close the file being read. You need to do this to prevent the imagereader object from being damaged. However, since it is a read-only file, the file will not be damaged when it is not closed. ImageClass - Image Object Image objects are the basic objects of machine vision operations. Constructor Class image.Image(path[, copy_to_fb=False]) Create a new image object from the file in path. Support image files in bmp/pgm/ppm/jpg/jpeg format. If copy_to_fb is True, the image will be loaded directly into the framebuffer and you can load large images. If False, the image will be loaded into the MicroPython heap, which is much smaller than the frame buffer. In OpenMV Cam M4, if copy_to_fb is False, you should try to keep the image size below 8KB. If True, the image can be up to 160KB. In OpenMV Cam M7, if copy_to_fb is False, you should try to keep the image size below 16KB. If True, the image can be up to 320KB. The image supports the \"[]\" notation. Let image[index] = 8/16-bit value to assign image pixels or image[index] and get an image pixel. If it is a grayscale image of 16-bit RGB565 value for RGB image, this pixel is 8 Bit. For JPEG images, \"[]\" gives you access to JPEG image patches in the form of compressed section arrays. Since JPEG images are in the form of compressed byte streams, reading and writing of data sets is opaque. The image also supports read buffer operations. You can use the image as a section array object and enter the image into all types of MicroPython functions. If you want to transfer an image, you can pass it to the UART / SPI / I2C write function for automatic transfer. method image.width() Returns the width of the image in pixels. image.height() Returns the height of the image in pixels. image.format() Returns sensor.GRAYSCALE for grayscale images, sensor.RGB565 for RGB images, and sensor.JPEG for JPEG images. image.size() Returns the image size in bytes. image.get_pixel(x, y[, rgbtuple]) Grayscale: Returns the grayscale pixel value at the (x, y) position.

For odd lines, where the pixels in the image are G/B/G/B/etc. Each pixel is 8 bits. image.set_pixel(x, y, pixel) Grayscale: Set the pixel at the (x, y) position to the grayscale value pixel . RGB image: Set the pixel at the (x, y) position to RGB888 tuple (r, g, b) pixel . Compressed images are not supported. image.get_pixel() and image.set_pixel() are the only ways you can manipulate Bayer mode images. The Bayer pattern image is a text image. For even rows, where the pixels in the image are R/G/R/G/ and so on.

Bias is 0.0 to return the minimum value for each region, and bias is 1.0 to return the maximum value for each region. This method allows you to quickly reduce the image on the original image. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. image.midpoint_pooled(x_div, y_div[, bias=0.5]) Finds the midpoint value of the x_div * y_div square in the image and returns a new image consisting of the midpoint values ​​of each square. Bias is 0.0 to return the minimum value for each region, and bias is 1.0 to return the maximum value for each region. This method allows you to create a reduced copy of the image. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. image.to_grayscale([copy=False]) Convert the image to a grayscale image. This method also modifies the base image pixels and changes the image size in bytes, so it can only be done on grayscale images or RGB565 images. Otherwise copy must be True to create a new modified image on the heap. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. image.to_rgb565([copy=False]) Convert an image to a color image. This method also modifies the base image pixels and changes the image size in bytes, so it can only be done on RGB565 images. Otherwise copy must be True to create a new modified image on the heap. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. image.to_rainbow([copy=False]) Convert an image to a rainbow image. This method also modifies the base image pixels and changes the image size in bytes, so it can only be done on RGB565 images. Otherwise copy must be True to create a new modified image on the heap. A rainbow image is a color image that has a unique color value for each 8-bit mask grayscale illumination value in the image. For example, it provides a heat map color for a thermal image. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. image.compress([quality=50]) JPEG properly compresses the image. Using this method to use a higher quality compression ratio is at the expense of destroying the original image compared to the compressed save heap space. Quality is the compression quality (0-100) (int). image.compress_for_ide([quality=50]) JPEG properly compresses the image. Using this method to use a higher quality compression ratio is at the expense of destroying the original image compared to the compressed save heap space. This method compresses the image and then formats the JPEG data by encoding each 6 bits into a byte between 128 and 191 and converts it to OpenMV IDE for display. This step is done to prevent JPEG data from being mistaken for other text data in the byte stream. You need to use this method to format the image data for display in the terminal window created by Open Terminal in OpenMV IDE. Quality is the compression quality (0-100) (int). image.compressed([quality=50]) Returns a JPEG compressed image - the original image is unprocessed. However, this method requires a large allocation of heap space, so image compression quality and image resolution must be low. Quality is the compression quality (0-100) (int). image.compressed_for_ide([quality=50]) Returns a JPEG compressed image - the original image is unprocessed. However, this method requires a large allocation of heap space, so image compression quality and image resolution must be low. This method compresses the image and then formats the JPEG data by encoding each 6 bits into a byte between 128 and 191 and converts it to OpenMV IDE for display. This step is done to prevent JPEG data from being mistaken for other text data in the byte stream. You need to use this method to format the image data for display in the terminal window created by Open Terminal in OpenMV IDE. Quality is the compression quality (0-100) (int). image.copy([roi[, copy_to_fb=False]]) Create a copy of the image object. Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI copies the image rectangle of the entire image. But this does not apply to JPEG images. Remember that the image copy is stored in the MicroPython heap instead of the frame buffer. Again, you need to keep the image copy size below 8KB (OpenMV) or below 16KB (OpenMV Cam M7). If you want to use a copy operation to use all the heap space, this function will get an exception. An oversized image can easily trigger an exception. If copy_to_fb is True, this method replaces the framebuffer with an image. The frame buffer has much larger space than the heap and can accommodate large images. image.save(path[, roi[, quality=50]]) Save a copy of the image to the file system in path. Support image files in bmp/pgm/ppm/jpg/jpeg format. Note: You cannot save a compressed image in jpeg format to an uncompressed format. Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI copies the image rectangle of the entire image. But this does not apply to JPEG images. Quality refers to the JPEG compression quality that saves the image to JPEG format when the image has not been compressed. image.clear() Set all pixels in the image to zero (very fast). Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Compressed images are not supported. image.draw_line(x0, y0, x1, y1[, color[, thickness=1]]) Draw a line from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1) on the image. You can pass x0, y0, x1, y1 individually or to a tuple (x0, y0, x1, y1). Color is the RGB888 tuple for grayscale or RGB565 images. The default is white. However, you can also pass the base pixel value of the grayscale image (0-255) or the byte of the RGB565 image to invert the RGB565 value. Thickness The thickness of the control line.

For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values ​​- the minimum gray value and the maximum gray value. Only pixel regions that fall between these thresholds are considered. For RGB565 images, each tuple needs to have six values ​​(l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - the minimum and maximum values ​​for the LAB L, A and B channels, respectively. For ease of use, this feature will automatically fix the minimum and maximum values ​​of the exchange. Also, if the tuple is greater than six values, the remaining values ​​are ignored. Conversely, if the tuple is too short, the remaining thresholds are assumed to be in the maximum range. annotation To get the threshold of the tracked object, simply select (click and drag) the tracking object in the IDE framebuffer. The histogram will be updated accordingly to the area. Then just write down the color distribution in the starting and falling positions in each histogram channel. These will be the low and high values ​​of thresholds. Since the difference between the upper and lower quartiles is small, the threshold is manually determined. You can also determine the color threshold by going to Tools -> Machine Vision -> Threshold Editor in the OpenMV IDE and dragging the slider from the GUI window.

Only the pixels set in the mask are modified. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.laplacian(size[, sharpen=False[, mul[, add=0[, threshold=False[, offset=0[, invert=False[, mask=None]]]]]]) The image is convolved by edge detection of the Laplacian kernel. Size is the size of the kernel. Take 1 (3x3 core), 2 (5x5 core) or higher. If sharpen is set to True, this method will instead sharpen the image instead of just outputting edge-detected images that have not been thresholded. Increase the kernel size and increase the image clarity. Mul is the number used to multiply the result of the convolutional pixel. If not set, it defaults to a value that will prevent scaling in the convolution output. Add is the number used to add the convolution result to each pixel. Mul can be used for global contrast adjustment, and add can be used for global brightness adjustment. If you want to adaptively set the threshold on the output of the filter, you can pass the threshold=True parameter to initiate adaptive threshold processing of the image, which is based on the brightness of the ambient pixel (the brightness of the pixels around the kernel function). Set to 1 or 0. A negative offset value sets more pixels to 1, while a positive value only sets the strongest contrast to 1. Set invert to invert the result output of the binary image. Mask is another image used as a pixel-level mask for drawing operations. The mask should be an image with only black or white pixels and should be the same size as the image you are drawing. Only the pixels set in the mask are modified. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.bilateral(size[, color_sigma=0.1[, space_sigma=1[, threshold=False[, offset=0[, invert=False[, mask=None]]]]]) The image is convolved by a bilateral filter. A bilateral filter smoothes the image while maintaining the edges in the image. Size is the size of the kernel. Take 1 (3x3 core), 2 (5x5 core) or higher. The color_sigma control uses a bilateral filter to match the proximity of the color. Increasing this value increases the color blur. Space_sigma controls the degree to which pixels are blurred in space. Increasing this value increases pixel blur. If you want to adaptively set the threshold on the output of the filter, you can pass the threshold=True parameter to initiate adaptive threshold processing of the image, which is based on the brightness of the ambient pixel (the brightness of the pixels around the kernel function). Set to 1 or 0. A negative offset value sets more pixels to 1, while a positive value only sets the strongest contrast to 1. Set invert to invert the result output of the binary image. Mask is another image that is used as a pixel-level mask for drawing operations. The mask should be an image with only black or white pixels and should be the same size as the image you are drawing. Only the pixels set in the mask are modified. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.cartoon(size[, seed_threshold=0.05[, floating_threshold=0.05[, mask=None]]]) Roam the image and fill all the pixel areas in the image using the flood-fills algorithm. This effectively removes texture from the image by flattening the colors in all areas of the image. For best results, the image should have a lot of contrast so that the areas don't penetrate too easily. Seed_threshold Controls the difference between the pixels in the fill area and the original start pixel. Floating_threshold Controls the difference between pixels in the fill area and any adjacent pixels. Mask is another image that is used as a pixel-level mask for drawing operations. The mask should be an image with only black or white pixels and should be the same size as the image you are drawing. Only the pixels set in the mask are modified. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.remove_shadows([image]) Remove the shadow from the image. If the current image does not have a \"shadowless\" version, this method will attempt to remove the shadow from the image, but there is no true unshaded image basis. This algorithm is suitable for removing shadows in a flat, uniform background. Note that this method takes many seconds to run and is only suitable for removing shadows in real time, dynamically generating an unshadowed version of the image. Future versions of the algorithm will work for more environments, but equally slow. If the current image has a \"shadowless\" version, this method will remove all shadows in the image using the \"true source\" background unshadowed image to filter out the shadows. Non-shaded pixels are not filtered out, so you can add new objects that didn't exist before to the scene, and any non-shaded pixels in those objects will be displayed. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Only RGB565 images are supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.chrominvar() Remove the lighting effect from the image, leaving only the color gradient. Faster than image.illuminvar() but affected by shadows. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Only RGB565 images are supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.illuminvar() Remove the lighting effect from the image, leaving only the color gradient. Slower than image.chrominvar() but not affected by shadows. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Only RGB565 images are supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.linpolar([reverse=False]) The image is re-projected from Cartesian coordinates to linear polar coordinates. Set reverse = True to re-project in the opposite direction. Linear polar re-projection converts image rotation to x translation. Compressed images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.logpolar([reverse=False]) The image is re-projected from Cartesian coordinates to log polar coordinates. Set reverse = True to re-project in the opposite direction. Log-polar polar re-projection converts the rotation of the image to x translation and zoom to y translation. Compressed images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.lens_corr([strength=1.8[, zoom=1.0]]) Perform lens distortion correction to remove the fisheye effect caused by the lens. Strength is a floating point number that determines how much the fisheye effect is applied to the image. By default, try the value of 1.8 first, then adjust this value to make the image show the best results. Zoom is the value at which the image is scaled. The default is 1.0. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. img.rotation_corr([x_rotation=0.0[, y_rotation=0.0[, z_rotation=0.0[, x_translation=0.0[, y_translation=0.0[, zoom=1.0]]]]]) The perspective problem in the image is corrected by performing a 3D rotation of the frame buffer. X_rotation is the degree to which the image is rotated in the frame buffer around the x-axis (this causes the image to rotate up and down). Y_rotation is the degree of rotation of the image around the y-axis in the frame buffer (ie, the image is rotated left and right). Z_rotation is the degree by which the image is rotated in the frame buffer around the z-axis (ie, the image is rotated to the appropriate position). X_translation is the number of units that move the image to the left or right after rotation. Because this transformation is applied in 3D space, the unit is not a pixel... Y_translation is the number of units that move the image up or down after rotation. Because this transformation is applied in 3D space, the unit is not a pixel... Zoom is the amount that is scaled by the image. By default 1.0. Returns an image object so that you can use the . notation to call another method. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.get_similarity(image) Returns a \"similarity\" object describing the two images using the SSIM algorithm to compare the similarities of 8x8 pixel patches between the two images. Image can be an image object, the path to an uncompressed image file (bmp/pgm/ppm), or a scalar value. If a scalar value, the value can be an RGB888 tuple or a base pixel value (eg, an 8-bit grayscale of a grayscale image or a byte-inverted RGB565 value of an RGB image). Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.get_histogram([thresholds[, invert=False[, roi[, bins[, l_bins[, a_bins[, b_bins]]]]]]) Normalize histogram operations on all color channels of roi and return histogram objects. Please refer to the histogram object for more information. You can also call this method using image.get_hist or image.histogram . If you pass the thresholds list, the histogram information will only be calculated from the pixels in the threshold list. The thresholds must be a list of tuples. [(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)] Define the range of colors you want to track. For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values ​​- the minimum gray value and the maximum gray value. Only pixel regions that fall between these thresholds are considered. For RGB565 images, each tuple needs to have six values ​​(l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - the minimum and maximum values ​​for the LAB L, A and B channels, respectively. For ease of use, this feature will automatically fix the minimum and maximum values ​​of the exchange. Also, if the tuple is greater than six values, the remaining values ​​are ignored. Conversely, if the tuple is too short, the remaining thresholds are assumed to be in the maximum range. annotation To get the threshold of the tracked object, simply select (click and drag) the tracking object in the IDE framebuffer. The histogram will be updated accordingly to the area. Then just write down the color distribution in the starting and falling positions in each histogram channel. These will be the low and high values ​​of thresholds. Since the difference between the upper and lower quartiles is small, the threshold is manually determined. You can also determine the color threshold by going to Tools -> Machine Vision -> Threshold Editor in the OpenMV IDE and dragging the slider from the GUI window. Invert Reverses the threshold operation, where pixels are matched outside of the known color range, not within the known color range. Unless you need to use color statistics for advanced operations, simply use the image.get_statistics() method instead of this method to see the pixel areas in the image. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Bins and other bins are the number of bins used for the histogram channel. For grayscale images, use bins, for RGB565 images, use each of the other channels. The bin count for each channel must be greater than 2. In addition, it makes no sense to set the bin count to a number greater than the unique pixel value of each channel. By default, the histogram will have the maximum number of bins per channel. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. image.get_statistics([thresholds[, invert=False[, roi[, bins[, l_bins[, a_bins[, b_bins]]]]]]) Calculates the average, median, value, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, lower quartile, and upper quartile for each color channel in roi and returns a data object. See the statistics object for more information. You can also call this method using image.get_stats or image.statistics . If you pass the thresholds list, the histogram information will only be calculated from the pixels in the threshold list. The thresholds must be a list of tuples. [(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)] Define the range of colors you want to track. For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values ​​- the minimum gray value and the maximum gray value. Only pixel regions that fall between these thresholds are considered. For RGB565 images, each tuple needs to have six values ​​(l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - the minimum and maximum values ​​for the LAB L, A and B channels, respectively.

You can also determine the color threshold by going to Tools -> Machine Vision -> Threshold Editor in the OpenMV IDE and dragging the slider from the GUI window. Invert Reverses the threshold operation, where pixels are matched outside of the known color range, not within the known color range. You can use this method when you need to get a pixel area information in an image. For example, if you want to use the frame difference method to detect motion, you need to use this method to determine the change in the color channel of the image, which triggers the motion detection threshold. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Bins and other bins are the number of bins used for the histogram channel. For grayscale images, use bins, for RGB565 images, use each of the other channels. The bin count for each channel must be greater than 2. In addition, it makes no sense to set the bin count to a number greater than the unique pixel value of each channel. By default, the histogram will have the maximum number of bins per channel. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. image.get_regression(thresholds[, invert=False[, roi[, x_stride=2[, y_stride=1[, area_threshold=10[, pixels_threshold=10[, robust=False]]]]]]) Perform linear regression calculations on all threshold pixels of the image. This calculation is done by least squares, which is usually faster, but does not handle any outliers. If robust is True, the Theil index will be used. The Theil index calculates the median of all slopes between all threshold pixels in the image. If you set too many pixels after the threshold transition, even on an 80x60 image, this N^2 operation may lower your FPS below 5. However, as long as the number of pixels to be set after the threshold conversion is small, linear regression is effective even when the threshold pixel exceeding 30% is an abnormal value. This method returns an image.line object. How to easily use straight line objects, see the following blog post: https://openmv.io/blogs/news/linear-regression-line-following The thresholds must be a list of tuples. [(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)] Define the range of colors you want to track. For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values ​​- the minimum gray value and the maximum gray value. Only pixel regions that fall between these thresholds are considered. For RGB565 images, each tuple needs to have six values ​​(l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - the minimum and maximum values ​​for the LAB L, A and B channels, respectively.

Invert Reverses the threshold operation, where pixels are matched outside of the known color range, not within the known color range. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. X_stride is the number of x pixels to skip when calling a function. Y_stride is the number of y pixels to skip when calling a function. Returns None if the bounding box area after the regression is smaller than area_threshold . Returns None if the number of pixels after regression is less than pixel_threshold . Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. image.find_blobs(thresholds[, invert=False[, roi[, x_stride=2[, y_stride=1[, area_threshold=10[, pixels_threshold=10[, merge=False[, margin=0[, threshold_cb =None[, merge_cb=None]]]]]]]]]]]) Finds all the patches in the image and returns a list of patch objects that include each patch. Please observe the image.blob object for more information. The thresholds must be a list of tuples. [(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)] Define the range of colors you want to track. For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values ​​- the minimum gray value and the maximum gray value. Only pixel regions that fall between these thresholds are considered.

Invert Reverses the threshold operation, where pixels are matched outside of the known color range, not within the known color range. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. X_stride is the number of x pixels that need to be skipped when looking for a patch. Once the color block is found, the line fill algorithm will be precise pixels. If the color block is known to be large, increase x_stride to increase the speed at which the color block is found. Y_stride is the number of y pixels that need to be skipped when looking for a patch. Once the color block is found, the line fill algorithm will be precise pixels. If the color block is known to be large, increase y_stride to increase the speed at which the patch is found. If the bounding box area of ​​a patch is smaller than area_threshold, it will be filtered out. If the number of pixels in a patch is smaller than pixel_threshold, it will be filtered out. Merge If True, merges all the patches that have not been filtered. The border rectangles of these patches overlap each other. Margin can be used in the intersection test to increase or decrease the size of the patch boundary rectangle. For example, patches with edges of 1 and border rectangles of 1 will be merged. Merging patches allows color code tracking to be achieved. Each patch object has a code value code , which is a bit vector. For example, if you enter two color thresholds in image.find_blobs, the first threshold code is 1 and the second code is 2 (the third code is 4, the fourth code is 8, and so on). Merged patches use logical OR operations on all code so you know the color that produced them. This allows you to track two colors, and if you get a patch object in two colors, it might be a color code. If you use a strict color range and cannot fully track all the pixels of the target object, you may need to merge the patches. Finally, if you want to merge the patches, but don't want the two different threshold colors to be merged, just call image.find_blobs twice, and the different threshold patches will not be merged. The threshold_cb can be set to a function that calls each color block after threshold filtering to filter it out of the list of patches to be merged. The callback function will receive a parameter: the patch object to be filtered. The callback function then returns True to preserve the color block or return False to filter the color block. Merge_cb can be set to function to call two patches to be merged to disable or permit the merge. The callback function will receive two arguments - two patch objects that will be merged. The callback function must return True to merge the color blocks, or return False to prevent color block merging. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. image.find_lines([roi[, x_stride=2[, y_stride=1[, threshold=1000[, theta_margin=25[, rho_margin=25]]]]]) Use the Hough transform to find all the lines in the image. Returns a list of image.line objects. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. X_stride is the number of x pixels that need to be skipped during the Hough transform. If the line is known to be large, increase x_stride. Y_stride is the number of y pixels that need to be skipped during the Hough transform. If the line is known to be large, increase y_stride. Threshold Controls the line that is detected from the Hough transform. Only return lines that are greater than or equal to threshold. The correct threshold value for the application depends on the image. Note: The magnitude of a line is the sum of the size of all Sobel filter pixels that make up the line. Theta_margin controls the merging of the lines being monitored. The part of the line angle of theta_margin is merged with the part of the line p value of rho_margin. Rho_margin controls the merging of the lines being monitored. The part of the line angle of theta_margin is merged with the part of the line p value of rho_margin. The method performs a Hough transform by running a Sobel filter on the image and using the amplitude and gradient response of the filter. No pre-processing of the image is required. However, cleaning up the image filter results in more stable results. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.find_line_segments([roi[, merge_distance=0[, max_theta_difference=15]]]) Use Hough transform to find line segments in the image. Returns a list of image.line objects. Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Merge_distance specifies the maximum number of pixels between two segments that can be separated from each other without being merged. Max_theta_difference is the maximum angle difference between the two line segments that merge_distancede will merge above. This method uses the LSD library (also used by OpenCV) to find line segments in the image. This is a bit slow, but very accurate, the line segments won't jump. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.find_circles([roi[, x_stride=2[, y_stride=1[, threshold=2000[, x_margin=10[, y_margin=10[, r_margin=10]]]]]]) Use the Hough transform to find a circle in the image. Returns a list of image.circle objects (see above). Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. X_stride is the number of x pixels that need to be skipped during the Hough transform. If the circle is known to be large, increase x_stride. Y_stride is the number of y pixels that need to be skipped during the Hough transform. If the circle is known to be large, increase y_stride. Threshold Controls the circle detected from the Hough transform. Only returns a circle greater than or equal to threshold. The correct threshold value for the application depends on the image. Note: The magnitude of a circle is the sum of the size of all Sobel filter pixels that make up the circle. X_margin controls the merge of the detected circles. The round pixels are partially merged for x_margin , y_margin , and r_margin . Y_margin controls the merge of the detected circles. The round pixels are partially merged for x_margin , y_margin , and r_margin . R_margin Controls the merge of the detected circles. The round pixels are partially merged for x_margin , y_margin , and r_margin . Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.find_rects([roi=Auto, threshold=10000]) Use the same quad detection algorithm used to find AprilTAg to find rectangles in the image. Ideal for rectangles that contrast sharply with the background. AprilTag's quad detection can handle arbitrary scaling/rotating/cutting rectangles. Returns a list of image.rect objects. Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. The border size (by sliding the Sobel operator over all pixels on the edge of the rectangle and adding the value) is smaller than the rectangle of the threshold and is filtered from the return list. The correct value for threshold depends on your application/scenario. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.find_qrcodes([roi]) Find all the QR codes in roi and return a list of image.qrcode objects. Please refer to the image.qrcode object for more information. In order for this method to work successfully, the QR code on the image needs to be flat. By using the sensor.set_windowing function to zoom in at the center of the lens, the image.lens_corr function to dissipate the barrel distortion of the lens, or by replacing a lens with a narrow field of view, you get a flatter QR code that is unaffected by lens distortion. Some machine vision lenses do not cause barrel distortion, but they are much more expensive than the standard lenses offered by OpenMV, which is an undistorted lens. Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. Image.find_apriltags([roi[, families=image.TAG36H11[, fx[, fy[, cx[, cy]]]]]) Find all AprilTags in roi and return a list of image.apriltag objects. Please refer to the image.apriltag object for more information. Compared to QR codes, AprilTags can be detected in longer distances, poorer light, and more distorted image environments. AprilTags can handle all kinds of image distortion problems, and the QR code does not. That is, AprilTags can only encode the digital ID as its payload. AprilTags can also be used for localization. Each image.apriltag object returns its three-dimensional position information and rotation angle from the camera. The position information is determined by fx, fy, cx, and cy, which are the focal length and center point of the image in the X and Y directions, respectively. Create AprilTags using the Tag Generator tool built into OpenMV IDE. The tag generator creates a printable 8.5\"x11\" AprilTags. Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. The family is the bit mask of the tag family to be decoded. Is a logical or: image.TAG16H5 image.TAG25H7 image.TAG25H9 image.TAG36H10 image.TAG36H11 image.ARTOOLKIT The default setting is the best image.TAG36H11 tag family. Note: every time a tag family is enabled, the speed of find_apriltags will be slightly slower. Fx is the focal length of the camera's x-direction in pixels. The value of the standard OpenMV Cam is (2.8 / 3.984) * 656, which is obtained by dividing the focal length value of the millimeter by the length of the photosensitive element in the X direction and multiplying by the number of pixels of the photosensitive element in the X direction (for the OV7725 photosensitive element) In terms of). Fy is the focal length of the camera in the y direction in pixels. The value of the standard OpenMV Cam is (2.8 / 2.952) * 488, which is obtained by dividing the focal length value of the millimeter meter by the length of the photosensitive element in the Y direction, and multiplying by the number of pixels of the photosensitive element in the Y direction (for the OV7725 photosensitive element) In terms of). Cx is the center of the image, image.width()/2 , not roi.w()/2 . Cy is the center of the image, image.height()/2, not roi.h()/2 . Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. Image.find_datamatrices([roi[, effort=200]]) Finds all the data matrices in roi and returns a list of image.datamatrix objects. Please refer to the image.datamatrix object for more information. In order for this method to work successfully, the rectangular code on the image needs to be flat. By using the sensor.set_windowing function to zoom in on the center of the lens, the image.lens_corr function to dissipate the barrel distortion of the lens, or by replacing a lens with a narrow field of view, you get a flatter rectangular code that is unaffected by lens distortion. Some machine vision lenses do not cause barrel distortion, but they are much more expensive than the standard lenses offered by OpenMV, which is an undistorted lens. Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. The effort controls the time used to find the rectangular code match. The default value of 200 should apply to all use cases. However, you may also increase the detection at the expense of the frame rate or increase the frame rate at the expense of detection. Note: If the effort is set below about 160, you will not be able to perform any tests; instead, you can set it to any high value you want, but if the setting is higher than 240, the detection rate will not continue to increase. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.find_barcodes([roi]) Find all the 1D barcodes in roi and return a list of image.barcode objects. Please refer to the image.barcode object for more information. For best results, use a long 640, wide 40/80/160 window. The lower the degree of verticality, the faster the speed. Since the barcode is a linear one-dimensional image, it is only necessary to have a higher resolution in one direction and a lower resolution in the other direction. Note: This function performs horizontal and vertical scanning, so you can use a window with a width of 40/80/160 and a length of 480. Finally, be sure to adjust the lens so that the bar code is positioned where the focal length produces the sharpest image. Fuzzy barcodes cannot be decoded. This function supports all 1D barcodes: image.EAN2 image.EAN5 image.EAN8 image.UPCE image.ISBN10 image.UPCA image.EAN13 image.ISBN13 image.I25 image.DATABAR (RSS-14) image.DATABAR_EXP (RSS-Expanded) image.CODABAR image.CODE39 image.PDF417 image.CODE93 image.CODE128 Roi is a region of interest (x, y, w, h) of a rectangle to be copied. If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. Image.find_displacement(template[, roi[, template_roi[, logpolar=False]]]) Find the transform offset for this image from the template. This method can be used to make light flow. This method returns an image.displacement object containing the results of the displacement calculation using phase correlation. Roi is a rectangular area (x, y, w, h) that needs to be processed. If not specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Template_roi is the rectangular area (x, y, w, h) that needs to be processed. If not specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Roi and template roi must have the same w/h, but x/y can be anywhere in the image. You can slide a smaller rois on a larger image to get a smoother image of the light flow. Image.find_displacement usually calculates the x/y translation between two images. However, if you set logpolar = True , it will find a change in rotation and scaling between the two images. The same image.displacement object results in two possible feedbacks. Compressed images and bayer images are not supported. annotation Use this method on images with a uniform length and width (for example, sensor.B64X64). This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.find_number(roi) A LENET-6 CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) trained on the MINST data set is run to detect numbers in the 28x28 ROI located anywhere on the image. Returns a tuple containing integers and floating point numbers representing the detected number (0-9) and the confidence of the detection (0-1). Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Only grayscale images are supported. annotation This method is experimental. This method may be removed if you run any CNN that Caffe trains on your PC in the future. This function has been removed by the latest 3.0.0 firmware. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. image.classify_object(roi) Run CIFAR-10 CNN on the ROI of the image to detect aircraft, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, boats and trucks. This method automatically scales the image internally to 32x32 to feed to the CNN. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Only RGB565 images are supported. annotation This method is experimental. This method may be removed if you run any CNN that Caffe trains on your PC in the future. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. Image.find_template(template, threshold[, roi[, step=2[, search=image.SEARCH_EX]]]) Try to find the location of the first template match in the image using the Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) algorithm. Returns the bounding box tuple (x, y, w, h) of the matching position, otherwise returns None. Template is a small image object that matches this image object. Note: Both images must be grayscale. Threshold is a floating point number (0.0-1.0), where a smaller value increases the detection rate while increasing the false positive rate. Conversely, a higher value reduces the detection rate while reducing the false positive rate. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Step is the number of pixels that need to be skipped when looking up the template. Skip pixels can greatly increase the speed at which the algorithm runs. This method is only applicable to the algorithm in SERACH_EX mode. Search can be used for image.SEARCH_DS or image.SEARCH_EX. image.SEARCH_DS The algorithm used for searching templates is faster than image.SEARCH_EX, but if the template is around the edges of the image, it may not be searched successfully. image.SEARCH_EX performs a more detailed search of the image, but it runs much faster than image.SEARCH_DS . Only grayscale images are supported. image.find_features(cascade[, threshold=0.5[, scale=1.5[, roi]]]) This method searches for images of all regions that match Haar Cascade and returns a list of bounding box rectangle tuples (x, y, w, h) for these features. If no features are found, a blank list is returned. Cascade is a Haar Cascade object. See image.HaarCascade() for more information. Threshold is a floating point number (0.0-1.0), where a smaller value increases the detection rate while increasing the false positive rate. Conversely, a higher value reduces the detection rate while reducing the false positive rate. Scale is a floating point number that must be greater than 1.0. A higher scale factor runs faster, but its image matching is poorer. The ideal value is between 1.35 and 1.5. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Only grayscale images are supported. image.find_eye(roi) Find the pupil in the region of interest (x, y, w, h) around the eye. Returns a tuple containing the position of the pupil (x, y) in the image. If no pupil is found, it returns (0,0). Before using this function, you first need to search for someone's face using image.find_features() and Haar operator frontalface. Then use image.find_features and Haar operator find_eye to search for the eye on the face. Finally, this method is called on each eye ROI returned after calling the image.find_features function to get the coordinates of the pupil. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Only grayscale images are supported. image.find_lbp(roi) The LBP (local binary mode) key points are extracted from the ROI tuple (x, y, w, h). You can use the image.match_descriptor function to compare two sets of key points to get the matching distance. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Only grayscale images are supported. image.find_keypoints([roi[, threshold=20[, normalized=False[, scale_factor=1.5[, max_keypoints=100[, corner_detector=image.CORNER_AGAST]]]]]) The ORB key points are extracted from the ROI tuple (x, y, w, h). You can use the image.match_descriptor function to compare two sets of key points to get the matching area. If no key is found, return None. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Threshold is a number that controls the number of extractions (values ​​0-255). For the default AGAST corner detector, this value should be around 20. For the FAST corner detector, this value is approximately 60-80. The lower the threshold, the more corner points you extract. Normalized is a boolean value. If True, close the extraction keypoint at multiple resolutions. If you don't care about handling extensions and want the algorithm to run faster, set it to True. Scale_factor is a floating point number that must be greater than 1.0. A higher scale factor runs faster, but its image matching is poorer. The ideal value is between 1.35 and 1.5. Max_keypoints is the maximum number of key points a keypoint object can hold. If the key point object is too large and causes memory problems, lower the value. Corner_detector is the corner detector algorithm used to extract key points from an image. Can be image.CORNER_FAST or image.CORNER_AGAST . The FAST corner detector runs faster, but with less accuracy. Only grayscale images are supported. image.find_edges(edge_type[, threshold]) Turn the image into black and white and leave only the edges as white pixels. image.EDGE_SIMPLE - Simple threshold high-pass filtering algorithm image.EDGE_CANNY - Canny edge detection algorithm Threshold is a binary tuple containing a low threshold and a high threshold. You can control the edge quality by adjusting this value. The default is (100, 200). Only grayscale images are supported. Find_hog([roi[, size=8]]) The pixels in the ROI are replaced with HOG (Directed Gradient Histogram) lines. Roi is a rectangular tuple of interest regions (x, y, w, h). If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to pixels in the roi area. Only grayscale images are supported. This method is not available on OpenMV Cam M4. Constant image.SEARCH_EX Detailed template matching search. image.SEARCH_DS Faster template matching search. image.EDGE_CANNY Edge detection is performed on the image using the Canny edge detection algorithm. image.EDGE_SIMPLE Edge detection is performed on the image using a threshold high-pass filtering algorithm. image.CORNER_FAST High-speed low-accuracy corner detection algorithm for ORB key points image.CORNER_AGAST Low speed high accuracy algorithm for ORB key points. image.TAG16H5 Bitmask enumeration for the TAG1H5 tag group.

If the link jumps in a mess, it will cause the document to look messy and it will be difficult to read. Chinese and English (multi-language) page file directory structure and file name are the same Since there are multiple language switching options in the last generated page, clicking the switch will directly access the same path of the corresponding language, so the Chinese and English directory structure and file name must be the same. For example, English is accessing en/get_started/how_to_read.md. After clicking the button for language switching, it will automatically access zh/get_started/how_to_read.md. If this file does not exist, it will report a 404 error! Module Document Content Need to include a module introduction in the file header Need to explain the constructor, function, constant, etc. Explain that you can't be lazy. Simply translate the function name again. You need to explain the function of the function, the range of parameters, and the point of attention Multi-version management In addition to the Chinese and English (multi-language) support (not automatic translation, manual modification), the document also has multi-version management. Each version is a branch with requirements for the branch name, which are: master branch is the main branch dev branch for development branch Other published historical versions start with a lowercase v, such as creating a branch called v1.2 After creating a new branch, you need to modify the version link in book.json in the directory of each language version, otherwise the reader can't find the entry.
