How to use (/read) this article correctly
==========

* Just contact, you can look carefully from the top to the next page according to the directory on the left sidebar.

* Then learn how to update the firmware, how to write code

* Every module's doc contains examples at the end of page, you can try it out ~

* Finally, the interface and parameters of the module are consulted according to their own needs during use. There is a search box in the upper left corner, which can be used well. You can also use the browser's page search function, ie press <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd>, then enter the content to search and press the enter key

* If you can't find anything, please don't worry, you can go to github's issue ([document issue](https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy_DOC/issues), [code issue](https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy/issues)) Is there any mention of the page (/search)? If you don't have one, you can create a new issue or contact technical support.


* If pages load slowly, refresh or just wait, or change your network

* Doc pages generated by gitbook, there  may be some error occur when click too fast but network speed not enough, just take care of the url( path ), for example:

Wrong url:

```
http://localhost:4000/zh/zh/get_started/how_to_read.html
```
Correct url:

http://localhost:4000/zh/get_started/how_to_read.html

so just change the wrong url, or just back to (`maixpy.sipeed.com`) refresh page
